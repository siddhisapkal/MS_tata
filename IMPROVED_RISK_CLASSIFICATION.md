# 🎯 Improved Risk Classification System

## ✅ **Fixed Risk Type Classification**

### 🚫 **Previous Issue:**
- All articles were classified as "Strategic" risk type
- No diversity in risk categorization
- Poor risk assessment accuracy

### ✅ **New Intelligent Classification:**

#### **🔍 Content-Based Risk Type Detection:**

1. **🔗 Supply Chain** - Keywords: supply chain, shortage, semiconductor, chip, lithium, battery, raw material, component, disruption
2. **📋 Regulatory** - Keywords: policy, regulation, subsidy, FAME, government, ministry, compliance, standard, emission, safety
3. **⚙️ Operational** - Keywords: recall, defect, safety, quality, manufacturing, production, facility, plant, assembly
4. **💻 Technology** - Keywords: technology, innovation, battery, charging, autonomous, AI, software, digital, connectivity
5. **🏆 Competitive** - Keywords: competitor, Mahindra, Maruti, Hyundai, Toyota, Honda, market share, competition, rival
6. **💰 Financial** - Keywords: financial, revenue, profit, loss, investment, funding, merger, acquisition, partnership, deal
7. **🔒 Cybersecurity** - Keywords: cyber, security, hack, breach, data, privacy, digital security
8. **🌱 Environmental** - Keywords: environmental, sustainability, carbon, emission, green, climate, ESG
9. **📊 Strategic** - Keywords: demerger, restructuring, reorganization, spin-off, divestment, strategic

#### **⚠️ Intelligent Severity Classification:**

**🔴 High Severity Keywords:**
- crisis, shortage, recall, defect, safety, emergency, urgent, critical, severe, major, significant, disruption, halt, stop, shutdown

**🟡 Medium Severity Keywords:**
- concern, issue, challenge, problem, delay, slow, decline, drop, fall, reduction, moderate, some, partial

**🟢 Low Severity Keywords:**
- growth, increase, rise, improvement, positive, good, strong, record, success, achievement, milestone

#### **📊 Enhanced Risk Score Calculation:**

**Base Score:** Relevance score × 10

**Risk Type Adjustments:**
- Supply Chain: +1.0 (critical for automotive)
- Regulatory: +0.8 (significant business impact)
- Operational: +1.2 (very serious - recalls, defects)
- Technology: +0.5 (important but manageable)
- Competitive: +0.3 (moderate impact)
- Financial: +0.7 (significant impact)
- Cybersecurity: +1.5 (very serious)
- Environmental: +0.6 (important)

**Severity Adjustments:**
- High severity keywords: +1.0
- Medium severity keywords: +0.5
- Low severity keywords: -0.5

**Final Score:** Capped between 0-10

### 🎯 **Expected Results:**

Now you'll see diverse risk types like:
- **Supply Chain** for semiconductor shortage articles
- **Regulatory** for EV policy and FAME scheme articles
- **Operational** for recall and safety articles
- **Technology** for battery and charging infrastructure articles
- **Competitive** for competitor analysis articles
- **Financial** for revenue and investment articles
- **Strategic** for demerger and restructuring articles

### 📈 **Benefits:**

1. **🎯 Accurate Classification**: Content-based risk type detection
2. **📊 Diverse Categories**: 9 different risk types instead of just "Strategic"
3. **⚠️ Smart Severity**: Keyword-based severity assessment
4. **📈 Better Scoring**: Nuanced risk score calculation
5. **🔍 Context-Aware**: Analyzes both title and content
6. **🚗 Industry-Specific**: Tailored for automotive/EV risks

Your risk classification is now much more intelligent and will provide accurate, diverse risk types for each article! 🚗⚡
