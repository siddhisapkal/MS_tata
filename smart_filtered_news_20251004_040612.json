    "Title": "No suds for you! Asahi attack leaves Japanese drinkers dry",
    "Explanation": "Ransomware has left Japan's biggest brewer struggling to ship beer, with Asahi warning domestic customers to brace for patchy supplies while its core systems stay offline.\n\nLast week, Asahi suffered an online invasion that shut down its Japanese distribution system and call centers, but in a Friday update, the venerable drinks biz said systems weren't restored yet and that only limited manual orders and deliveries had begun.\n\nAsahi hasn't responded to our questions about the incident. However, it has confirmed ransomware was to blame in its press release and said there are traces suggesting a possible unauthorized data transfer. The brewer is keeping technical details under wraps, claiming disclosure could cause further damage.\n\n\"To prevent further damage, we are withholding specific details regarding the cyberattack,\" Asahi said.\n\n\"We placed the highest priority on safeguarding critical data, including the personal information of our customers and business partners, and promptly isolated the affected systems to minimize the impact,\" it added. \"We are conducting [an] investigation to determine the nature and scope of the information that may have been subject to unauthorized transfer.\"\n\nThe attack did not halt brewing itself, but it forced the company to switch to manual processing of orders. Limited shipments resumed on Friday, while call centers are slated to partially restart during the week of October 6, and CEO Atsushi Katsuki offered his apologies.\n\n\"I would like to sincerely apologize for any difficulties caused to our stakeholders by the recent system disruption,\" he said.\n\n\"We are making every effort to restore the system as quickly as possible, while implementing alternative measures to ensure continued product supply to our customers. We appreciate your understanding and support.\"\n\nRetailers are already reporting shortages, with Japan's 7-Eleven operator Seven & i and rival FamilyMart saying they've been affected and that some stores are running low on beer and non-alcoholic lines. Asahi has said it is still reviewing the potential impact of the attack on its financial results.\n\n\"It's a bit of a problem,\" Tokyo chef Tomiko Yano of Kushiyaki Tosaka told Reuters. \"We specialize in yakitori (skewered chicken) and it pairs really well with Super Dry. A lot of customers say that, so I'm a little worried (about the shortage).\"\n\nThankfully for the rest of Asahi's customers, the incident is affecting only the Japanese mainland. The company controls brewery brands around the globe, but these remain unaffected it seems.\n\nBut the case shows just how vulnerable large corporations are to the effects of being penetrated, even national icons. This week Jaguar Land Rover, the venerable British automaker owned by Tata Motors, secured an about $2 billion loan guarantee from the UK government after a cyberattack halted production at its factories.\n\nOfficials said the support was essential to protect the thousands of third-party suppliers the car maker relies on. There's no such argument for Asahi, and the Japanese government rarely helps companies in these situations, so the dry spell looks set to continue. ®",

    "Explanation": "India achieved its highest Navratri sales in over a decade, propelled by government GST reforms that lowered prices and boosted consumer aspirations. This led to record consumption, with major auto and electronics companies like Maruti Suzuki, M&M, Hyundai, LG, and Haier reporting their best-ever festive season performance.\n\nIndia saw its highest Navratri sales in over a decade propelled by the government's GST reforms that reduced tax rates and made products more accessible, as per government sources.\n\nSources said these measures lowered prices and boosted consumer aspirations, enabling families to upgrade vehicles, invest in home appliances, and spend more freely on lifestyle goods, turning festive cheer into record-breaking consumption.\n\nET reported in its Friday edition that leading companies including Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindra, Reliance Retail, Hyundai, LG Electronics and Haier have clocked decade's best sales during this year's Navratri.\n\nCiting data, government sources said Maruti Suzuki's Navratri sales grew 100%, which doubled from last year. The company reported 3.5 lakh bookings with nearly 2.5 lakh pending bookings. By end of the Navratri period, it is confident of touching the 2 lakh mark in deliveries as compared to 85,000 vehicles retailed last Navratri.\n\nM&M reported a retail jump of 60% year-on-year, as per the sources. At Hyundai, the surge in demand for models like Creta and Venue pushed SUVs' share of total sales to over 72%.\n\nShowroom footfalls of two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp have doubled this Navratri with high traction in the commuter segment. Tata Motors retailed more than 50,000 vehicles during the festive period, with demand from Altroz, Punch, Nexon and Tiago models. Bajaj Auto also reported strong sales during Navratri, government sources said.\n\nIn the consumer electronics space, LG, Haier and Godrej Appliances reported high double-digit sales growth. For instance, Haier's sales soared 85%, nearly selling out its Diwali stock of 85-inch and 100-inch TVs priced above ₹2.5 lakh.",

    "Explanation": "NEW DELHI: The festive rush is there but car and two-wheeler companies, flush with orders after GST reduction and price cuts, are now facing a unique problem -- 'on time delivery' of vehicles during festivals.While customers are seeking delivery around Dhanteras and Diwali, companies are finding it challenging to do so due to shortage of trucks and trailers. The shortage of rare earth magnets, despite initial assurances around normalisation of supplies from China, is also delaying production, particularly of electrics and two-wheelers.Industry officials told TOI that sudden rush in demand for deliveries -- across automobiles, FMCG, ecommerce, fashion and lifestyle segments -- has put a huge pressure on the truck industry with fleets working round-the-clock to deliver across the country. \"Add to this the usual gifting rush around Diwali and you have a problem that is increasingly becoming very challenging to solve,\" an industry official said.\"Surge in festive demand has led to significant constraints on availability of trailers. We are working to improve dispatches to our dealer network within constraints,\" Nalinikanth Gollagunta, CEO, automotive division, M&M said.The same situation is being faced by Maruti, which has seen a huge recovery in demand for small cars after GST cut. \"We have pending deliveries of 2.5 lakh vehicles, and most people prefer it around Diwali . We are working overtime and are now using railways to ensure that dispatches happen faster and on time,\" Partho Banerjee, senior executive officer (marketing & sales) at Maruti Suzuki, said.Amit Kamat, chief commercial officer at Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles, said surge in demand for trailers and trucks began after Sept 22 as new GST rates came into play. \"We expect this surge to be temporary and are working with logistics partners to expedite dispatches... Despite challenges, we are working tirelessly to expedite deliveries to our dealerships in time for Diwali celebrations.\"Luxury players, such as BMW, are also feeling the pinch due to sudden rush in demand. \"Customers like to take the delivery on Dhanteras and Diwali. This year, demand for deliveries on these specific days is much higher as pent-up demand from Aug-Sept is also coming into play... When the bottleneck suddenly opened, there were certain logistics challenges in the start, but they are streamlined now,\" Hardeep Singh Brar, president and CEO of BMW Group India, said.It's similar for two-wheeler industry. Apart from logistics, companies are also plagued by shortage of magnets. \"The cut in retail prices has meant that there has been a sudden rise in demand for scooters and motorcycles. Rare earth magnet issue is hampering production. Sudden rush in bookings is leading to pressure on deliveries,\" a top official of a leading company said.",

    "Title": "India Sees Record Navratri Sales as GST Cuts and Swadeshi Push Boost Festive Consumption",
    "Explanation": "India recorded its highest Navratri sales in more than a decade, with consumer demand surging across automobiles, electronics, and lifestyle goods, as recent tax reforms and a growing preference for domestic products lifted festive sentiment.\n\nIndustry players and trade bodies reported sales growth ranging between 25% and 100% during the nine-day festival, crediting the government's cuts in Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates for lowering prices and expanding access to aspirational products. The surge comes at the start of the month-long Diwali season, with traders projecting record sales of ₹4.75 lakh crore this year -- up from ₹4.25 lakh crore in 2024.\n\nAuto sector leads the charge\n\nCarmaker Maruti Suzuki posted its best-ever Navratri sales in at least a decade, doubling year-on-year volumes. The company reported 150,000 bookings and expects to reach 200,000, with 1.65 lakh deliveries in just eight days. On the first day alone, Maruti delivered 30,000 cars, marking its strongest single-day performance in 35 years.\n\nSUV maker Mahindra & Mahindra saw retail sales rise 60%, while Hyundai reported SUVs accounting for over 72% of total sales, driven by Creta and Venue models. Tata Motors retailed more than 50,000 vehicles, led by demand for the Altroz, Punch, Nexon, and Tiago. Two-wheeler leader Hero MotoCorp reported a doubling of showroom footfalls, and Bajaj Auto also logged strong sales momentum.\n\nConsumer electronics boom\n\nFestive demand also buoyed the electronics sector. Haier saw sales soar 85%, nearly exhausting its Diwali stock of large-screen TVs, while LG and Godrej Appliances reported double-digit growth. Reliance Retail posted a 20-25% increase, led by smartphones, fashion, and TVs, while Vijay Sales also reported sales growth above 20%.\n\nTraders eye record Diwali season\n\nThe Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) projected Diwali sales to cross ₹4.75 lakh crore, citing both tax reforms and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call for \"Vocal for Local - Local for Global\" as key drivers. CAIT's survey of 35 cities found strong consumer preference for Indian-made goods across categories ranging from clay lamps and handicrafts to automobiles, electronics, and FMCG products.\n\n\"Every rupee spent on Indian goods this Diwali strengthens the economy, generates jobs, and fulfills the vision of a self-reliant India,\" said CAIT Secretary General and MP Praveen Khandelwal at a press conference in New Delhi. He described this year's festival as \"Apni Diwali - Bharatiya Diwali\", underscoring the growing Swadeshi sentiment.\n\nChinese imports sidelined\n\nThe shift away from Chinese goods -- a trend that has gathered momentum since the 2020 Galwan Valley clash -- has intensified, with traders saying Diwali markets this year are dominated by Indian-made products. Categories such as home décor, textiles, toys, and puja items are seeing a surge in demand for Swadeshi alternatives.\n\nA consumption-driven boost\n\nThe festive calendar, stretching from Navratri through Diwali and Chhath Puja, accounts for 40-45% of annual retail sales. This year's record numbers signal a broader boost for India's consumption-driven economy at a time when global growth remains uncertain.\n\nEconomists say GST rationalisation, combined with pent-up demand and a cultural shift toward local goods, has amplified consumer confidence. With decorated bazaars, swelling footfalls, and record order books, India's 2025 festive season appears set to cement its place as both a celebration of tradition and a showcase of economic momentum.",

    "Title": "IPO-bound Tata Capital bets on green energy financing, tech push for growth",
    "Explanation": "Tata Capital Ltd, set to launch its IPO next week, has identified green financing and digital innovation as its core growth pillars, backed by the merger of its IFC-backed subsidiary Tata Cleantech Capital in 2024.\n\nIMAGE: Saurabh Agrawal, Chairman of Tata Capital Limited, and Rajiv Sabharwal, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer. Photograph: Francis Mascarenhas/Reuters\n\nBy FY25, the cleantech and infrastructure finance book reached Rs 18,000 crore, growing at a 31.8 per cent CAGR over the last two years, the NBFC said on Friday.\n\n\"Over the last decade, the cleantech portfolio has financed over 500 renewable projects and sanctioned more than 22,400 MW of capacity across solar, wind, biomass, small hydro, among others,\" MD and CEO Rajiv Sabharwal said.\n\n\"The cleantech segment combines rapid growth with high-quality, secured assets, underpinned by technology-driven monitoring and disciplined underwriting.\n\n\"The portfolio is among the cleanest in the NBFC space, positioning the company as a key mobilizer of global climate capital,\" he said.\n\nThe Tata Group NBFC said it is building for the long term with a vision anchored on trust, customer-centricity, and responsible partnership.\n\nLeveraging the Tata brand, it aims to become a financial leader while ensuring stability across cycles.\n\nSpeaking about growth outlook, Sabharwal said, \"India's high growth pace and relatively low credit penetration offer strong expansion potential.\n\n\"NBFCs, with their nimbleness in technology adoption and branch rollouts, are outpacing overall credit growth.\n\n\"Its loan book has accelerated, led by housing (one-third of growth), consumer lending, and SMEs - the backbone of the economy.\"\n\nThe company stated it underscored its granular loan book, low unsecured exposure, and multi-product strategy to balance growth and risk.\n\nHowever, post the Tata Motors Finance acquisition, net NPA stands at 1 per cent, while excluding it, the figure is 0.6 per cent.\n\nCapital adequacy is expected at 22 per cent post-IPO, Tata Capital CFO Rakesh Bhatia said.\n\nChief Operating Officer Abonty Banerjee said the company has deployed GenAI in underwriting for working capital loans, which it said has dramatically reduced turnaround time for credit appraisal memos.\n\nWith India's 2070 net-zero target offering a massive runway for green financing, Tata Capital said it is uniquely placed to support the country's energy transition while presenting a strong investment case to IPO investors.\n\nThe IPO will open on October 6 with a price band of Rs 310-Rs 326 per equity share and a minimum lot size of 46 shares. The company aims to raise over Rs 15,500 crore from the issue.",

      "body": "Tata Capital Ltd, set to launch its IPO next week, has identified green financing and digital innovation as its core growth pillars, backed by the merger of its IFC-backed subsidiary Tata Cleantech Capital in 2024.\n\nIMAGE: Saurabh Agrawal, Chairman of Tata Capital Limited, and Rajiv Sabharwal, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer. Photograph: Francis Mascarenhas/Reuters\n\nBy FY25, the cleantech and infrastructure finance book reached Rs 18,000 crore, growing at a 31.8 per cent CAGR over the last two years, the NBFC said on Friday.\n\n\"Over the last decade, the cleantech portfolio has financed over 500 renewable projects and sanctioned more than 22,400 MW of capacity across solar, wind, biomass, small hydro, among others,\" MD and CEO Rajiv Sabharwal said.\n\n\"The cleantech segment combines rapid growth with high-quality, secured assets, underpinned by technology-driven monitoring and disciplined underwriting.\n\n\"The portfolio is among the cleanest in the NBFC space, positioning the company as a key mobilizer of global climate capital,\" he said.\n\nThe Tata Group NBFC said it is building for the long term with a vision anchored on trust, customer-centricity, and responsible partnership.\n\nLeveraging the Tata brand, it aims to become a financial leader while ensuring stability across cycles.\n\nSpeaking about growth outlook, Sabharwal said, \"India's high growth pace and relatively low credit penetration offer strong expansion potential.\n\n\"NBFCs, with their nimbleness in technology adoption and branch rollouts, are outpacing overall credit growth.\n\n\"Its loan book has accelerated, led by housing (one-third of growth), consumer lending, and SMEs - the backbone of the economy.\"\n\nThe company stated it underscored its granular loan book, low unsecured exposure, and multi-product strategy to balance growth and risk.\n\nHowever, post the Tata Motors Finance acquisition, net NPA stands at 1 per cent, while excluding it, the figure is 0.6 per cent.\n\nCapital adequacy is expected at 22 per cent post-IPO, Tata Capital CFO Rakesh Bhatia said.\n\nChief Operating Officer Abonty Banerjee said the company has deployed GenAI in underwriting for working capital loans, which it said has dramatically reduced turnaround time for credit appraisal memos.\n\nWith India's 2070 net-zero target offering a massive runway for green financing, Tata Capital said it is uniquely placed to support the country's energy transition while presenting a strong investment case to IPO investors.\n\nThe IPO will open on October 6 with a price band of Rs 310-Rs 326 per equity share and a minimum lot size of 46 shares. The company aims to raise over Rs 15,500 crore from the issue.",

    "Title": "India records highest navratri sales in a decade, powered by GST reforms: Govt sources",
    "Explanation": "New Delhi [India] October 3 (ANI): India recorded its highest Navratri sales in over 10 years, driven by a combination of festive demand and the NextGen GST reforms, according to government sources.\n\nThe rationalisation of GST slabs and targeted measures to make essential and aspirational goods more accessible have significantly boosted consumer confidence, resulting in record-breaking consumption across key sectors, they said.\n\n'GST reforms under the Modi government have lowered the tax burden on the middle class and unlocked aspirations across India. This Navratri has validated the impact of these reforms on the ground,' a senior government official said.\n\nIndia has adopted a simplified two-tier tax system, effective from September 22, under which the majority of goods and services are taxed at 5% and 18%, instead of the four tax slabs previously in place. A 40% tax is levied on ultra-luxury items.\n\nThe auto industry was among the biggest beneficiaries. Maruti Suzuki reported its best-ever Navratri performance in a decade, with deliveries crossing 2 lakh vehicles, and bookings hitting 3.5 lakh. On the first day of Navratri alone, it delivered a record 30,000 cars--its highest in 35 years.\n\nMahindra & Mahindra saw a 60 per cent year-on-year increase in retail sales, driven by high demand for the XUV700 and Scorpio N. Hyundai's SUV sales also surged, with models like Creta and Venue pushing SUVs to over 72 per cent of its total sales. Tata Motors retailed over 50,000 vehicles, while Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto reported strong growth, especially in the commuter and two-wheeler segments.\n\nIn the consumer electronics space, brands reported double-digit to near triple-digit growth. Haier's sales rose 85 per cent, nearly exhausting its Diwali inventory of premium large-screen TVs. Reliance Retail experienced a 20-25 per cent increase in sales, driven by categories such as smartphones, fashion, and TVs. Vijay Sales and LG India also reported strong growth, attributing momentum to festive offers and GST-driven price stability.\n\nGovernment sources highlighted that the first half of the festive season--Onam to Dussehra--typically accounts for 40-45 per cent of annual festive sales, making it the largest consumption period in India. With brands and retailers clocking 25 per cent to 100 per cent growth, this season underscores India's strength as a consumption-driven economy, bolstered by proactive fiscal policy and structural tax reforms.

    "Title": "Tata Capital raises ₹4,641 crore from anchor investors ahead of IPO",
    "Explanation": "Tata Capital secured Rs 4,641 crore from anchor investors including LIC, mutual funds and global institutions ahead of its Rs 15,512-crore IPO, the largest-ever NBFC issue\n\nTata Capital on Friday allotted 142.4 million shares to anchor investors, raising Rs 4,641 crore. The shares were allotted at Rs 326 apiece, the top end of the price band.\n\nAmong the prominent anchor investors, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) received the largest allotment of over 21.4 million shares, committing close to Rs 700 crore. Domestic mutual funds accounted for 35.55 per cent of the total anchor allocation, with over 50 million shares distributed across 18 mutual funds and 59 schemes.\n\nNotable mutual fund participants included ICICI Prudential, HDFC Mutual Fund, Aditya Birla Sun Life, DSP, Axis Mutual Fund, Nippon India, Edelweiss, Kotak and Motilal Oswal.\n\nForeign institutional investors such as Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and the State of Michigan Retirement System also featured prominently among the anchor investors, each receiving substantial allocations.\n\nTata Capital's Rs 15,512-crore IPO -- the fourth largest in the domestic market and the biggest-ever non-banking finance company (NBFC) offering -- opens for public subscription on Monday.\n\nAlso Read\n\nIPO-bound Tata Capital focuses on green financing, tech for growth\n\nIPO Calendar: Tata Capital, LG India to open; 29 listings next week\n\nCan Tata Capital IPO, Tata Motors demerger lift sentiment of group stocks?\n\nTata Investment shares up for 3rd day on heavy volumes, zoom 32% in 6 days\n\nWant more retail investors in Tata Capital story: MD & CEO Rajiv Sabharwalpremium\n\nThe IPO comprises a fresh issue of shares worth Rs 6,846 crore, which will be used to augment the company's capital base. In addition, promoter Tata Sons and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) will offload shares worth Rs 8,666 crore. Following the IPO, Tata Sons' holding in Tata Capital will decline from 95.6 per cent to 85.5 per cent.\n\nTata Capital's IPO is the largest public offering ever from the Tata Group and the second from the conglomerate in nearly two decades, after Tata Technologies in November 2023. It is also the biggest IPO in the domestic market since Hyundai Motor India's record Rs 27,869-crore issue in June 2024.\n\nClassified as an \"upper layer\" NBFC by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Tata Capital was mandated to list.\n\nEstablished in 2007, Tata Capital has grown into India's third-largest NBFC, with a loan book of Rs 2.33 trillion as of June 2025. Its portfolio is diversified, with retail loans accounting for 61.3 per cent, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) 26.2 per cent and corporate loans 12.5 per cent.\n\nThe recent merger with Tata Motors Finance, a leading commercial vehicle financier with assets under management (AUM) of Rs 36,515 crore as of December 2024, has further strengthened its position.

    "Explanation": "Tata Motors Demerger: Stock exchange NSE is scheduled to conduct a special pre-opening trade session for Tata Motors this month. The bourse's special session will last an hour. Tata Motors has demerged its commercial vehicle (CV) business into a separate entity.\n\nWith the demerger, which took effect on October 1, the Tata group auto giant's commercial vehicle (CV) and passenger vehicle (PV) units became two separate entities. These entities are set to be listed separately on the bourses. Currently, only Tata Motors is listed, with investors reacting to developments in both units using the same stock.\n\nTata Motors demerger record date\n\nInvestors holding Tata Motors shares on October 14 will qualify for one equity share of the CV unit for every share held in Tata Motors.\n\nThe CV unit will be listed as TML Commercial Vehicles. The already listed entity will be renamed as Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles.\n\nThe stock will be listed on exchanges BSE and NSE at a later date.\n\nTata Motors special pre-open timings on October 14\n\nNSE will be conducting the pre-opening session from 9 am to 10 am on October 14.\n\nALSO READ: Could Rs 15,500-crore Tata Capital IPO be a game-changer? Here's what CEO Rajiv Sabharwal thinks\n\nWhen will Tata Motors CV shares be listed on Dalal Street?\n\nThe Tata Motors management revealed at an analyst meeting that the CV business will likely to start trading on the bourses sometime around mid-November, subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nHere are answers to a few frequently asked questions (FAQs) on the subject:\n\nHow does a demerger impact shareholders?\n\nIn a listed company's demerger into two or more listed entities, shareholders of the parent company typically receive shares of the demerged entity in a pre-decided ratio.\n\nDoes the demerged entity get listed automatically?\n\nNo. The demerged entity must fulfil several regulatory and exchange-related requirements before it enters the secondary market.\n\nHow is the shareholding ratio decided?\n\nThis ratio is determined based on the parent company and the demerged business's valuations.\n\nHow are stock prices impacted post-demerger?\n\nThe share price of the parent company may adjust to reflect the value of the demerged business that has moved out.",

    "Title": "GST Reforms 2025: India Records Highest Navratri Sales in a Decade, Powered by NextGen GST Reforms, Says Govt Sources | LatestLY",
    "Explanation": "New Delhi October 3: India recorded its highest Navratri sales in over 10 years, driven by a combination of festive demand and the NextGen GST reforms, according to government sources. The rationalisation of GST slabs and targeted measures to make essential and aspirational goods more accessible have significantly boosted consumer confidence, resulting in record-breaking consumption across key sectors, they said.\n\n\"GST reforms under the Modi government have lowered the tax burden on the middle class and unlocked aspirations across India. This Navratri has validated the impact of these reforms on the ground,\" a senior government official said. India has adopted a simplified two-tier tax system, effective from September 22, under which the majority of goods and services are taxed at 5% and 18%, instead of the four tax slabs previously in place. A 40% tax is levied on ultra-luxury items. GST Collections Rise 9.1% to INR 1.89 Lakh Crore in September, Marking 2nd Consecutive Growth.\n\nThe auto industry was among the biggest beneficiaries. Maruti Suzuki reported its best-ever Navratri performance in a decade, with deliveries crossing 2 lakh vehicles, and bookings hitting 3.5 lakh. On the first day of Navratri alone, it delivered a record 30,000 cars--its highest in 35 years. Mahindra & Mahindra saw a 60 per cent year-on-year increase in retail sales, driven by high demand for the XUV700 and Scorpio N. Hyundai's SUV sales also surged, with models like Creta and Venue pushing SUVs to over 72 per cent of its total sales. Tata Motors retailed over 50,000 vehicles, while Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto reported strong growth, especially in the commuter and two-wheeler segments.\n\nIn the consumer electronics space, brands reported double-digit to near triple-digit growth. Haier's sales rose 85 per cent, nearly exhausting its Diwali inventory of premium large-screen TVs. Reliance Retail experienced a 20-25 per cent increase in sales, driven by categories such as smartphones, fashion, and TVs. Vijay Sales and LG India also reported strong growth, attributing momentum to festive offers and GST-driven price stability. GST 2.0: What Gets Cheaper and Costlier? New GST Rates Announced for Cars, Cigarettes, Life Insurance and More - List Here.\n\nGovernment sources highlighted that the first half of the festive season--Onam to Dussehra--typically accounts for 40-45 per cent of annual festive sales, making it the largest consumption period in India. With brands and retailers clocking 25 per cent to 100 per cent growth, this season underscores India's strength as a consumption-driven economy, bolstered by proactive fiscal policy and structural tax reforms.",

      "body": "New Delhi October 3: India recorded its highest Navratri sales in over 10 years, driven by a combination of festive demand and the NextGen GST reforms, according to government sources. The rationalisation of GST slabs and targeted measures to make essential and aspirational goods more accessible have significantly boosted consumer confidence, resulting in record-breaking consumption across key sectors, they said.\n\n\"GST reforms under the Modi government have lowered the tax burden on the middle class and unlocked aspirations across India. This Navratri has validated the impact of these reforms on the ground,\" a senior government official said. India has adopted a simplified two-tier tax system, effective from September 22, under which the majority of goods and services are taxed at 5% and 18%, instead of the four tax slabs previously in place. A 40% tax is levied on ultra-luxury items. GST Collections Rise 9.1% to INR 1.89 Lakh Crore in September, Marking 2nd Consecutive Growth.\n\nThe auto industry was among the biggest beneficiaries. Maruti Suzuki reported its best-ever Navratri performance in a decade, with deliveries crossing 2 lakh vehicles, and bookings hitting 3.5 lakh. On the first day of Navratri alone, it delivered a record 30,000 cars--its highest in 35 years. Mahindra & Mahindra saw a 60 per cent year-on-year increase in retail sales, driven by high demand for the XUV700 and Scorpio N. Hyundai's SUV sales also surged, with models like Creta and Venue pushing SUVs to over 72 per cent of its total sales. Tata Motors retailed over 50,000 vehicles, while Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto reported strong growth, especially in the commuter and two-wheeler segments.\n\nIn the consumer electronics space, brands reported double-digit to near triple-digit growth. Haier's sales rose 85 per cent, nearly exhausting its Diwali inventory of premium large-screen TVs. Reliance Retail experienced a 20-25 per cent increase in sales, driven by categories such as smartphones, fashion, and TVs. Vijay Sales and LG India also reported strong growth, attributing momentum to festive offers and GST-driven price stability. GST 2.0: What Gets Cheaper and Costlier? New GST Rates Announced for Cars, Cigarettes, Life Insurance and More - List Here.\n\nGovernment sources highlighted that the first half of the festive season--Onam to Dussehra--typically accounts for 40-45 per cent of annual festive sales, making it the largest consumption period in India. With brands and retailers clocking 25 per cent to 100 per cent growth, this season underscores India's strength as a consumption-driven economy, bolstered by proactive fiscal policy and structural tax reforms.",

    "Explanation": "NEW DELHI: The festive rush is there but car and two-wheeler companies, flush with orders post the price cuts after the GST reduction, are now facing a unique problem - 'on time delivery' of vehicles during the festivals.While customers are seeking delivery during the auspicious period of Dhanteras and around Diwali, companies are increasingly finding it challenging to do so due to shortage of trucks and trailers. The shortage of rare earth magnets, which happens despite initial assurances around normalisation of supplies from China, is also delaying production, particularly of electrics and two-wheelers.Industry officials told TOI that the sudden rush in demand for deliveries - across industries such as automobiles, FMCG, ecommerce, fashion and lifestyle - has put a huge pressure on the trucking industry with trucking fleets working round-the-clock to deliver across the length and breadth of the country. \"Add to this the usual gifting rush around Diwali and you have a problem that is increasingly becoming very challenging to solve,\" an industry official said.The pressure on the auto companies is telling as most customers generally want to take delivery on Dhanteras and Diwali. The pressure for delivery is not just in the bigger towns and cities, but even in smaller towns and rural.\"The surge in festive demand has placed significant constraints on availability of trailers. We are working to improve dispatches to our dealer network within the constraints,\" Nalinikanth Gollagunta, CEO, Automotive Division, M&M said.The same situation is being faced by Maruti which has seen a huge recovery in demand for small cars after the GST cut. \"We have pending deliveries of as many as 2.5 lakh vehicles, and most people prefer it around the Diwali period. We are working overtime and are now using railways to ensure that dispatches happen faster and on time,\" Partho Banerjee, senior executive officer (Marketing & Sales) at Maruti Suzuki, said.Amit Kamat, chief commercial officer at Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles, said the surge in demand for trailers and trucks began after Sept 22 as the new GST rates came into play. \"We expect this surge to be temporary and are closely working with our logistics partners to expedite dispatches... Despite logistical challenges, we remain fully committed and are working tirelessly to expedite deliveries to our dealerships in time for Diwali celebrations.\" Luxury players such as BMW are also feeling the pinch due to the sudden rush in demand. \"Customers like to take the delivery on auspicious days like Dhanteras and Diwali. This year, demand for deliveries on these specific days is much higher as pent-up demand from Aug-Sept is also coming into play... When the bottleneck suddenly opened, yes, there were certain logistics challenges in the start, but it is streamlined now,\" Hardeep Singh Brar, president and CEO of BMW Group India, said.In the two-wheeler industry, there is a similar challenge. Apart from logistics, companies are also plagued by the shortage of magnets. \"The cut in retail prices has meant that there has been a sudden rise in demand for scooters and motorcycles. However, the rare earth magnet issue is hampering production. The sudden rush in bookings is leading to pressure on deliveries,\" a top official of a leading company said, requesting anonymity.",

    "Title": "Eternal block deal: Goldman Sachs offloads Rs 355 cr worth of shares, BofA Securities steps in as buyer",
    "Explanation": "Goldman Sachs sold over 1 crore shares of Eternal Limited for Rs 355.32 crore to BOFA Securities. Eternal, formerly Zomato, has surpassed Tata Motors and Titan in market capitalization, driven by strong performance in food delivery and quick commerce. Despite a 90% drop in Q1FY26 net profit due to investments, revenue surged, and HSBC reiterated a 'Buy' call.\n\nGoldman Sachs on Friday sold over 1 crore shares of food deliver and quick commerce company Eternal Limited for Rs 355.32 crore where the buyer was BOFA Securities. The shares were sold at a price of Rs 329 apiece, flat over the Wednesday closing price.\n\nToday Eternal shares closed at Rs 328.20 on the NSE, sliding marginally at Rs 0.80 or 0.24% over the previous closing price.\n\nOn September 22, Eternal shares hit their all-time high of Rs 343.90. Eternal shares are currently trading above their 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs) of Rs 319.3 and Rs 259.3 according to Trendlyne data.\n\nThe rally has come amid high volatility with 1-year beta of 1.3, the Trendlyne data suggested. The stock has delivered 20% returns over a 1-year period outperforming headline indices Nifty and BSE Sensex, whose returns are over negative 3%.\n\nRecently, international brokerage HSBC has reiterated its 'Buy' call on Eternal, raising its target price to Rs 390 per share from Rs 340, citing clear scale and profitability leadership in both food delivery and quick commerce.\n\nAlso Read: BNP Paribas acquires Rs 1,806 crore worth stakes in Nifty stocks Hero MotoCorp and IndusInd Bank via bulk deals\n\nEternal, which consolidates\n\nZomato and Blinkit, continues to outperform rival Swiggy on both operational and financial metrics. In quick commerce, Blinkit's net order value (NOV) surged by 125% year-on-year in Q1 FY26, far ahead of Swiggy's Instamart, which rose by 75%.\n\nEternal (formerly Zomato) recently reached another milestone in its market journey, surpassing\n\nTata Motors and Titan in market capitalisation. The company's market value now stands at Rs 3.16 lakh crore, above Tata Motors' Rs 2.63 lakh crore and Titan's Rs 3.06 lakh crore.\n\nThe food delivery company had reported a 90% year-on-year (YoY) drop in consolidated net profit for Q1FY26, at Rs 25 crore compared to Rs 253 crore in the same quarter last year. The revenue from operations of Rs 7,167 crore, up 70% from Rs 4,206 crore a year ago.\n\nThe sharp decline in profit was on account of the continuing investments in quick commerce segment and going-out.\n\nThe company also reported a 15% YoY jump in its Q1FY26 expenses to Rs 2,137 crore, primarily under heads such as 'Delivery and related charges' and 'Advertisement and sales promotion'.\n\nAlso Read: BSE launches hospitals index to track healthcare sector.

    "Title": "Festive Stocking, Tax Relief & GST Cuts To Drive Auto Demand In H2FY26: Report",
    "Explanation": "New Delhi: The Indian automobile industry is heading into the second half of FY26 with cautious optimism, as festive stocking, reduction in GST rates, and income tax relief are expected to boost consumer demand, a report said on Friday. Meanwhile, September sales data reflected a mixed trend -- with strong growth in two-wheelers, three-wheelers, commercial vehicles, and tractors, even as passenger vehicle volumes slipped on a Year-on-Year (YoY) basis, Axis Securities highlighted.\n\nTwo Wheeler/Three Wheeler (2W/3W) Segment\n\nDomestic two-wheeler sales rose 6 per cent YoY and 18 per cent month-on-month (MoM), supported by strong performances from Royal Enfield (43 per cent YoY), Suzuki Motorcycle (37 per cent YoY), and TVS Motor (12 per cent YoY). Exports remained firm, rising 17 per cent YoY and 2 per cent MoM, led by Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp, RE, and TVS.\n\nThree-wheeler sales recorded 12 per cent YoY and 6 per cent MoM growth, largely driven by M&M (30 per cent YoY) and TVS (60 per cent YoY), the report noted.\n\nPassenger Vehicles (PV)\n\nThe PV segment saw a 5 per cent YoY decline in wholesales, though sales rebounded 16 per cent MoM, aided by deferred inventory clearance and GST reductions.\n\nJSW MG Motor and Tata Motors outperformed with 47 per cent and 45 per cent YoY growth, respectively, followed by Toyota Kirloskar (31 per cent YoY) and M&M (10 per cent YoY). Maruti Suzuki, however, slipped 6 per cent YoY, while Hyundai remained flat.\n\nCompany-wise, Tata Motors' PV sales jumped 45 per cent YoY, while M&M's PV division rose 10 per cent YoY. Maruti Suzuki reported a 6 per cent YoY drop in domestic sales, though MoM performance improved 2 per cent.\n\nTractors\n\nThe tractor industry witnessed a sharp rebound, with volumes up 50 per cent YoY and 124 per cent MoM, buoyed by good monsoons and high reservoir levels. M&amp;M's tractor sales surged 50 per cent YoY and 148 per cent MoM, Escorts Kubota rose 49 per cent YoY and 125 per cent MoM, while VST Tillers and Tractors posted a 42 per cent YoY gain but fell 27 per cent sequentially.\n\nCommercial Vehicles (CV)\n\nDomestic CV sales rose 11 per cent YoY and 19 per cent MoM. Tata Motors and M&M recorded mid-double-digit growth, while Ashok Leyland reported a 9 per cent YoY rise. Eicher Motors' VECV division remained flat YoY, but improved 6 per cent MoM. Maruti Suzuki's CV sales fell 7 per cent YoY.\n\nAxis security said that it remains cautiously optimistic for H2FY26, expecting high single-digit growth in PVs and steady demand in CVs, supported by festive demand, GST cuts, rural recovery, and new model launches.\n\nTractor sales are also expected to remain buoyant, aided by improved kharif harvest and reservoir conditions, the domestic brokerage firm said.",

    "Title": "Navratri 2025 delivers decade-high sales, GST cuts drive festive boom, claim govt sources - CNBC TV18",
    "Explanation": "India's consumer economy records its best Navratri sales in over 10 years, driven by GST rationalisation, increased spending on automobiles and electronics, and rising festive sentiment ahead of Diwali.India's consumer economy recorded its strongest Navratri sales in more than a decade, fuelled by the Modi government's NextGen GST reforms that reduced tax rates and lifted consumer sentiment. Lower prices across essential and aspirational items encouraged households to make big-ticket purchases, ranging from automobiles to consumer durables, delivering a sharp boost to the consumption-driven economy.\n\nGovernment sources said the rationalisation of GST slabs has unlocked household aspirations, enabling families to upgrade vehicles, invest in home appliances, and spend more freely on lifestyle goods during the festive season.\n\n\"These measures not only lowered prices but also unlocked consumer aspirations, enabling families to upgrade vehicles, invest in home appliances, and spend more freely on lifestyle goods, turning festive cheer into record-breaking consumption,\" government sources said.\n\nAuto sales at record highs\n\nThe automobile sector was among the biggest beneficiaries of the spending surge. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd posted its best Navratri performance in at least a decade, doubling sales from last year. The company reported 3.5 lakh bookings with nearly 2.5 lakh pending bookings. By the end of Navratri, Maruti is confident of touching the 2 lakh mark in deliveries. The company retailed 85,000 vehicles last Navratri.\n\nIn the first eight days of Navratri alone, Maruti delivered 1.65 lakh vehicles, including a record 30,000 cars on Day 1 -- the highest single-day delivery in its 35-year history.\n\nSUV demand remained strong across brands. Mahindra & Mahindra reported a 60% year-on-year jump in sales, led by models such as the XUV700 and Scorpio N. Hyundai Motor Indiasaid SUVs accounted for more than 72% of its sales, driven by the Creta and Venue. Tata Motors reported retailing over 50,000 vehicles during the festival season, powered by demand for the Altroz, Punch, Nexon and Tiago.\n\nTwo-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp said showroom footfalls doubled, particularly in the commuter segment, while Bajaj Auto also reported strong festival sales.\n\nConsumer electronics ride festive demand\n\nThe consumer durables segment also witnessed unprecedented momentum. Haier India reported an 85% increase in sales, nearly exhausting its Diwali stock of large-screen premium televisions.\n\nSales of 65-inch models averaged 300-350 units a day, while high-end 85-inch and 100-inch TVs priced above ₹2.5 lakh saw robust demand.\n\nReliance Retail, India's largest retailer, reported a 20-25% rise in sales over last Navratri, with categories such as smartphones, fashion, and large-screen TVs leading growth. Vijay Sales recorded more than 20% growth, while LG Electronics India cited \"exponential growth\" in sales across product categories. Godrej Appliances also reported strong double-digit growth.\n\nFestive economy outlook\n\nIndustry executives note that the first half of the festive season -- covering Onam, Durga Puja, and Dussehra -- accounts for 40-45% of India's overall festive sales.\n\nWith growth ranging from 25% to 100% across categories this Navratri, analysts say consumer sentiment has entered a new phase of optimism.\n\n\"The GST reforms have clearly reduced the tax burden on households and supported a more confident spending environment,\" a government source said. \"The festive season is now translating that sentiment into record sales across sectors.\"\n\n\"By rationalising GST slabs and easing the tax burden on both essential and aspirational items, the government fostered an environment of confident spending. As a result, brands and retailers reported sales growth ranging from 25% to 100%, marking a major boost for India's consumption-driven economy. Importantly, the first half of the festive season, spanning Onam, Durga Puja, and Dussehra accounts for 40-45% of total festive sales making it the largest consumption period in the country,\" government sources said.\n\nWith Diwali ahead, retailers and manufacturers are optimistic that the momentum will continue, setting the stage for one of the strongest festive quarters for the Indian economy in recent memory.",

    "Title": "Jaguar Land Rover Shows Cyberattacks Mean Business",
    "Explanation": "The month-long outage for luxury car maker Jaguar Land Rover appears to be at an end, with the company working through a \"controlled, phased restart\" of its manufacturing operations this week, following a massive cyberattack that forced the company to shut down its systems.\n\nJLR said on Sept. 2 that it had \"proactively\" shut down operations following a cyber incident, initially stating that customer data did not seem to be stolen, but revising that statement a week later. JLR, a subsidiary of Tata Motors, likely suffered $50 million to $70 million in lost revenue per week, with the total cost of the incident estimated at a staggering $1.7 billion to $2.4 billion.\n\nThe attack, and its vast impact, should be a warning for companies, says Chris Gibson, executive director of the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST).\n\nThe outage \"highlights that even large corporations with substantial resources can be completely disrupted and that critical industries may be more vulnerable than previously thought,\" he says. \"This was far beyond data theft, it was a complete operational outage.\"\n\nAutomakers have become a favored target of ransomware gangs, as compromising their IT systems can lead to operations outages and faster payment. Honda suffered an outage in 2017 as it struggled to deal with the widespread WannaCry attacks, and again in 2020, when the company took its manufacturing offline following a compromise. Overall, about half of the top-100 automobile manufacturers are highly susceptible to ransomware, a 2022 report concluded.\n\nYet, the makers of automobiles are not the only manufacturers in cybercriminals' sights. Third-party manufacturer Visser Precision -- which supplies parts to Tesla, SpaceX, and Boeing -- suffered a breach in 2020. The HELLCAT gang claimed to have stolen sensitive data from industrial control system (ICS) maker Schneider Electric in 2024. And in June, steelmaker Nucor acknowledged a breach of its systems dating back to May 2025, with limited impact on operations.\n\nOpportunity Costs of Failed Defenses\n\nA Telegram channel using the name \"Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters\" -- an amalgamation of three well-known groups: Scattered Spider, Lapsus$, and ShinyHunters -- claimed responsibility for the attack by showing a screenshot of JLR's internal systems, according to threat researchers. For its part, JLR has not released any details of its investigations, but the company is working with third parties.\n\n\"Today we are informing colleagues, retailers, and suppliers that some sections of our manufacturing operations will resume in the coming days,\" JLR said in a Sept. 29 statement. \"We continue to work around the clock alongside cybersecurity specialists, the UK government's NCSC and law enforcement to ensure our restart is done in a safe and secure manner.\"\n\nThe company has stopped manufacturing at multiple factories, which typically produce 1,000 vehicles a day, according to reports. While the manufacturing \"pause\" was initially to be short-lived, the company extended it to Oct. 1.\n\nThe IT systems outage at the end of August was not the first sign of trouble that the company had.

      "body": "The month-long outage for luxury car maker Jaguar Land Rover appears to be at an end, with the company working through a \"controlled, phased restart\" of its manufacturing operations this week, following a massive cyberattack that forced the company to shut down its systems.\n\nJLR said on Sept. 2 that it had \"proactively\" shut down operations following a cyber incident, initially stating that customer data did not seem to be stolen, but revising that statement a week later. JLR, a subsidiary of Tata Motors, likely suffered $50 million to $70 million in lost revenue per week, with the total cost of the incident estimated at a staggering $1.7 billion to $2.4 billion.\n\nThe attack, and its vast impact, should be a warning for companies, says Chris Gibson, executive director of the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST).\n\nThe outage \"highlights that even large corporations with substantial resources can be completely disrupted and that critical industries may be more vulnerable than previously thought,\" he says. \"This was far beyond data theft, it was a complete operational outage.\"\n\nAutomakers have become a favored target of ransomware gangs, as compromising their IT systems can lead to operations outages and faster payment. Honda suffered an outage in 2017 as it struggled to deal with the widespread WannaCry attacks, and again in 2020, when the company took its manufacturing offline following a compromise. Overall, about half of the top-100 automobile manufacturers are highly susceptible to ransomware, a 2022 report concluded.\n\nYet, the makers of automobiles are not the only manufacturers in cybercriminals' sights. Third-party manufacturer Visser Precision -- which supplies parts to Tesla, SpaceX, and Boeing -- suffered a breach in 2020. The HELLCAT gang claimed to have stolen sensitive data from industrial control system (ICS) maker Schneider Electric in 2024. And in June, steelmaker Nucor acknowledged a breach of its systems dating back to May 2025, with limited impact on operations.\n\nOpportunity Costs of Failed Defenses\n\nA Telegram channel using the name \"Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters\" -- an amalgamation of three well-known groups: Scattered Spider, Lapsus$, and ShinyHunters -- claimed responsibility for the attack by showing a screenshot of JLR's internal systems, according to threat researchers. For its part, JLR has not released any details of its investigations, but the company is working with third parties.\n\n\"Today we are informing colleagues, retailers, and suppliers that some sections of our manufacturing operations will resume in the coming days,\" JLR said in a Sept. 29 statement. \"We continue to work around the clock alongside cybersecurity specialists, the UK government's NCSC and law enforcement to ensure our restart is done in a safe and secure manner.\"\n\nThe company has stopped manufacturing at multiple factories, which typically produce 1,000 vehicles a day, according to reports. While the manufacturing \"pause\" was initially to be short-lived, the company extended it to Oct. 1.\n\nThe IT systems outage at the end of August was not the first sign of trouble that the company had. In March, the HELLCAT ransomware group leaked 700 internal documents, purportedly part of a compromise of JLR's internal network using Jira credentials and also included development logs, source code, and a large employee dataset with usernames, email addresses, display names, and time zones, according to an analysis by threat intelligence firm Cyfirma.\n\nThe screenshot posted by the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunter group appears to show some development issues, and while the information leak may not have posed a risk on its own, the exposure of internal systems should have been concerning, the analysts stated.\n\n\"The targeting of operational systems, critical infrastructure, and connected vehicle modules suggests an interest in demonstrating control and influence, possibly to intimidate the company and its partners,\" Cyfirma stated in the analysis. \"While there is no direct evidence of ransom demands, the group could leverage the data for future exploitation or sell it, indicating potential financial incentives.\"\n\nThe Making of an Outage\n\nThe massive impact of the attack on JLR holds lessons, says FIRST's Gibson.

    "Title": "Tata Motors completes demerger of commercial vehicle business",
    "Explanation": "The demerger is a part of the firm's broader strategy to create focused verticals within the group each with independent governance and growth plans\n\nTata Motors (TML) on Friday said it has completed the demerger of its commercial vehicles (CV) business and the transfer of related group companies to TML Commercial Vehicles (TMLCV), as per the regulatory filings.\n\nThe development follows the sanction of the Composite Scheme of Arrangement by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Mumbai Bench, on August 25, 2025, with a subsequent rectification order on September 10, 2025.\n\nThe scheme, executed under Sections 230-232 of the Companies Act, 2013, enables the separation of the commercial vehicle and passenger vehicle businesses into distinct legal entities.\n\nPursuant to the scheme becoming effective, Tata Motors has transferred its entire shareholding in a wide range of direct and indirect subsidiaries, associates, and joint ventures to TMLCV.\n\nUnder the arrangement, Tata Motors' shareholding in several wholly-owned subsidiaries -- including Tata Motors Insurance Broking and Advisory Services, Tata Hispano Motors Carrocera, Tata Motors Body Solutions, TML CV Mobility Solutions, TMF Holdings, and TML Smart City Mobility Solutions -- now rests with TMLCV.\n\nThe demerger also includes indirect subsidiaries such as Tata Daewoo Mobility Company, PT Tata Motors Indonesia, TML CV Holdings, and TML CV Holdings, alongside their associated entities.\n\nIn addition, shareholdings in key associate companies -- including Automobile Corporation of Goa (49.77 per cent ), Tata Hitachi Construction Machinery Company (39.99 per cent ), and Freight Commerce Solutions (42.11 per cent on a fully diluted basis) -- have been transferred to TMLCV.\n\nJoint operations and ventures such as Tata Cummins, TCPL Green Energy Solutions, Tata Motors Digital.AI Labs, and Tata Motors Global Services are also part of the transfer.\n\nThe demerger is a part of Tata Motors' broader strategy to create focused verticals within the group -- commercial vehicles, passenger vehicles, and electric mobility -- each with independent governance and growth plans. The separation is expected to provide greater operational agility and enable each business to pursue its market-specific priorities.\n\nThe company has stated that all transfers are effective from the date of implementation of the scheme, and have been notified to stock exchanges, including BSE and NSE.",

      "body": "The demerger is a part of the firm's broader strategy to create focused verticals within the group each with independent governance and growth plans\n\nTata Motors (TML) on Friday said it has completed the demerger of its commercial vehicles (CV) business and the transfer of related group companies to TML Commercial Vehicles (TMLCV), as per the regulatory filings.\n\nThe development follows the sanction of the Composite Scheme of Arrangement by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Mumbai Bench, on August 25, 2025, with a subsequent rectification order on September 10, 2025.\n\nThe scheme, executed under Sections 230-232 of the Companies Act, 2013, enables the separation of the commercial vehicle and passenger vehicle businesses into distinct legal entities.\n\nPursuant to the scheme becoming effective, Tata Motors has transferred its entire shareholding in a wide range of direct and indirect subsidiaries, associates, and joint ventures to TMLCV.\n\nUnder the arrangement, Tata Motors' shareholding in several wholly-owned subsidiaries -- including Tata Motors Insurance Broking and Advisory Services, Tata Hispano Motors Carrocera, Tata Motors Body Solutions, TML CV Mobility Solutions, TMF Holdings, and TML Smart City Mobility Solutions -- now rests with TMLCV.\n\nThe demerger also includes indirect subsidiaries such as Tata Daewoo Mobility Company, PT Tata Motors Indonesia, TML CV Holdings, and TML CV Holdings, alongside their associated entities.\n\nIn addition, shareholdings in key associate companies -- including Automobile Corporation of Goa (49.77 per cent ), Tata Hitachi Construction Machinery Company (39.99 per cent ), and Freight Commerce Solutions (42.11 per cent on a fully diluted basis) -- have been transferred to TMLCV.\n\nJoint operations and ventures such as Tata Cummins, TCPL Green Energy Solutions, Tata Motors Digital.AI Labs, and Tata Motors Global Services are also part of the transfer.\n\nThe demerger is a part of Tata Motors' broader strategy to create focused verticals within the group -- commercial vehicles, passenger vehicles, and electric mobility -- each with independent governance and growth plans. The separation is expected to provide greater operational agility and enable each business to pursue its market-specific priorities.\n\nThe company has stated that all transfers are effective from the date of implementation of the scheme, and have been notified to stock exchanges, including BSE and NSE.",

    "Explanation": "\"GST reforms under the Modi government have lowered the tax burden on the middle class and unlocked aspirations across India\" - Senior Government Official\n\nThe rationalisation of GST slabs and targeted measures to make essential and aspirational goods more accessible have significantly boosted consumer confidence, resulting in record-breaking consumption across key sectors, they said.\n\n\"GST reforms under the Modi government have lowered the tax burden on the middle class and unlocked aspirations across India. This Navratri has validated the impact of these reforms on the ground,\" a senior government official said.\n\nIndia has adopted a simplified two-tier tax system, effective from September 22, under which the majority of goods and services are taxed at 5% and 18%, instead of the four tax slabs previously in place. A 40% tax is levied on ultra-luxury items.\n\nThe auto industry was among the biggest beneficiaries. Maruti Suzuki reported its best-ever Navratri performance in a decade, with deliveries crossing 2 lakh vehicles, and bookings hitting 3.5 lakh. On the first day of Navratri alone, it delivered a record 30,000 cars--its highest in 35 years.\n\nMahindra & Mahindra saw a 60 per cent year-on-year increase in retail sales, driven by high demand for the XUV700 and Scorpio N. Hyundai's SUV sales also surged, with models like Creta and Venue pushing SUVs to over 72 per cent of its total sales. Tata Motors retailed over 50,000 vehicles, while Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto reported strong growth, especially in the commuter and two-wheeler segments.\n\nIn the consumer electronics space, brands reported double-digit to near triple-digit growth. Haier's sales rose 85 per cent, nearly exhausting its Diwali inventory of premium large-screen TVs. Reliance Retail experienced a 20-25 per cent increase in sales, driven by categories such as smartphones, fashion, and TVs. Vijay Sales and LG India also reported strong growth, attributing momentum to festive offers and GST-driven price stability.\n\nGovernment sources highlighted that the first half of the festive season--Onam to Dussehra--typically accounts for 40-45 per cent of annual festive sales, making it the largest consumption period in India. With brands and retailers clocking 25 per cent to 100 per cent growth, this season underscores India's strength as a consumption-driven economy, bolstered by proactive fiscal policy and structural tax reforms.",

    "Title": "Navratri: Auto, appliance, consumer goods firms witness record sales",
    "Explanation": "New Delhi, Oct 3 (PTI) Major companies across sectors, including automakers, consumer electronics, and consumer goods, have reported record sales during the nine-day auspicious Navratri period, according to data shared by leading firms.\n\nThe robust sales were aided by the recent GST reform, which saw a substantial drop in tax rates, leading to price reductions across consumer goods, appliances, such as TVs (above 32-inch screen size), air conditioners and automobiles.\n\nThe industry reported a spike in sales from day one on September 22, when the new slashed rates came into effect.\n\nEncouraged by this, the makers of automobiles, appliances and consumer electronics expect a double-digit growth, in volume and value terms, in the almost 45-day-long festive season this year, which will conclude after Diwali.\n\nThe country's largest car maker, Maruti Suzuki India, reported sales of 1.65 lakh units in the first eight days of Navratri, its highest in the last 10 years.\n\nThe company expects to touch a whopping 2 lakh unit sales in the Navratra period.\n\nBesides, Maruti Suzuki reported pending bookings of nearly 2.5 lakh units. The company retailed 85,000 vehicles last Navratri.\n\nOther automakers like Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra and Hyundai Motor India also saw robust sales during the period.\n\nThe appliances and consumer electronics makers, such as LG, Haier, and Godrej Appliances, reported high double-digit sales growth this Navratri compared to the last year.\n\nHaier Appliances India has witnessed around 60 per cent year-on-year growth during Navratri. Moreover, consumers also upgraded their choices by going for higher screen sizes of TV sets and energy-efficient room air conditioners with smart features.\n\nHaier's sales soared 85 per cent, nearly selling out its Diwali stock of 85-inch and 100-inch TVs priced above Rs 2.5 lakh. The company also sold 300-350 units of 65-inch TVs daily during the period.\n\nSales at India's largest retailer Reliance Retail grew by 20-25 per cent over last year's Navratri, with categories like large-screen TVs, smartphones, and fashion driving the sales momentum. Electronics retail chain Vijay Sales too saw a more than 20 per cent sales growth.\n\nLG Electronics India also noted \"exponential growth\" in sales this Navratri season.\n\nThe rationalisation of GST slabs and easing the tax burden on essential and aspirational items has resulted in sales growth for India's consumption-driven economy.\n\nIn a landmark tax reform, the government has moved to two-tier slabs of 5 per cent and 18 per cent, effective from September 22, the first day of Navaratri.\n\nThis has led to the petrol, LPG and CNG vehicles of less than 1,200 cc and not more than 4,000 mm length and diesel vehicles of up to 1,500 cc and 4,000 mm length moving to the 18 per cent rate from the current 28 per cent.\n\nAll automobiles above 1,200 cc and longer than 4,000 mm, as well as motorcycles above 350 cc and racing cars, are being charged with a 40 per cent levy.\n\nWhile in appliances, the government has reduced 10 per cent duty on room-air conditioning (RAC) and TV screens above 32 inch size and dishwashers.\n\nThe festive season, which starts from Onam in South and stretches up to Diwali, covering Dussehra, accounts for 40-45 per cent of total sales, making it the largest consumption period in the country.

    "Explanation": "India Records Highest Navratri Sales (Representative image)India saw record-breaking Navratri sales, the highest in over 10 years, driven by festive demand and NextGen GST reforms. Simplified two-tier GST rates boosted consumer confidence, benefiting auto, electronics and retail sectors.&nbsp;\n\nNew Delhi [India] October 3 (ANI): India recorded its highest Navratri sales in over 10 years, driven by a combination of festive demand and the NextGen GST reforms, according to government sources. The rationalisation of GST slabs and targeted measures to make essential and aspirational goods more accessible have significantly boosted consumer confidence, resulting in record-breaking consumption across key sectors, they said.\n\nAdd Asianet Newsable as a Preferred Source\n\n\"GST reforms under the Modi government have lowered the tax burden on the middle class and unlocked aspirations across India. This Navratri has validated the impact of these reforms on the ground,\" a senior government official said.\n\nIndia has adopted a simplified two-tier tax system, effective from September 22, under which the majority of goods and services are taxed at 5% and 18%, instead of the four tax slabs previously in place. A 40% tax is levied on ultra-luxury items.\n\nAuto industry: The biggest beneficiary\n\nThe auto industry was among the biggest beneficiaries. Maruti Suzuki reported its best-ever Navratri performance in a decade, with deliveries crossing 2 lakh vehicles, and bookings hitting 3.5 lakh. On the first day of Navratri alone, it delivered a record 30,000 cars--its highest in 35 years.\n\nMahindra & Mahindra saw a 60 per cent year-on-year increase in retail sales, driven by high demand for the XUV700 and Scorpio N. Hyundai's SUV sales also surged, with models like Creta and Venue pushing SUVs to over 72 per cent of its total sales. Tata Motors retailed over 50,000 vehicles, while Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto reported strong growth, especially in the commuter and two-wheeler segments.\n\nIn the consumer electronics space, brands reported double-digit to near triple-digit growth. Haier's sales rose 85 per cent, nearly exhausting its Diwali inventory of premium large-screen TVs. Reliance Retail experienced a 20-25 per cent increase in sales, driven by categories such as smartphones, fashion, and TVs. Vijay Sales and LG India also reported strong growth, attributing momentum to festive offers and GST-driven price stability.\n\nGovernment sources highlighted that the first half of the festive season, Onam to Dussehra, typically accounts for 40-45 per cent of annual festive sales, making it the largest consumption period in India. With brands and retailers clocking 25 per cent to 100 per cent growth, this season underscores India's strength as a consumption-driven economy, bolstered by proactive fiscal policy and structural tax reforms.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by Asianet Newsable English staff and is published from a syndicated feed)\n\nRead Full Article",

    "Title": "India records highest navratri sales in a decade, powered by GST reforms: Govt sources",
    "Explanation": "New Delhi [India] October 3 (ANI): India recorded its highest Navratri sales in over 10 years, driven by a combination of festive demand and the NextGen GST reforms, according to government sources.\n\nThe rationalisation of GST slabs and targeted measures to make essential and aspirational goods more accessible have significantly boosted consumer confidence, resulting in record-breaking consumption across key sectors, they said.\n\nGST reforms under the Modi government have lowered the tax burden on the middle class and unlocked aspirations across India. This Navratri has validated the impact of these reforms on the ground, a senior government official said.\n\nIndia has adopted a simplified two-tier tax system, effective from September 22, under which the majority of goods and services are taxed at 5 and 18, instead of the four tax slabs previously in place. A 40 tax is levied on ultra-luxury items.\n\nThe auto industry was among the biggest beneficiaries. Maruti Suzuki reported its best-ever Navratri performance in a decade, with deliveries crossing 2 lakh vehicles, and bookings hitting 3.5 lakh. On the first day of Navratri alone, it delivered a record 30,000 cars--its highest in 35 years.\n\nMahindra & Mahindra saw a 60 per cent year-on-year increase in retail sales, driven by high demand for the XUV700 and Scorpio N. Hyundai SUV sales also surged, with models like Creta and Venue pushing SUVs to over 72 per cent of its total sales. Tata Motors retailed over 50,000 vehicles, while Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto reported strong growth, especially in the commuter and two-wheeler segments.\n\nIn the consumer electronics space, brands reported double-digit to near triple-digit growth. Haier sales rose 85 per cent, nearly exhausting its Diwali inventory of premium large-screen TVs. Reliance Retail experienced a 20-25 per cent increase in sales, driven by categories such as smartphones, fashion, and TVs. Vijay Sales and LG India also reported strong growth, attributing momentum to festive offers and GST-driven price stability.\n\nGovernment sources highlighted that the first half of the festive season--Onam to Dussehra--typically accounts for 40-45 per cent of annual festive sales, making it the largest consumption period in India. With brands and retailers clocking 25 per cent to 100 per cent growth, this season underscores India strength as a consumption-driven economy, bolstered by proactive fiscal policy and structural tax reforms.

      "body": "New Delhi [India] October 3 (ANI): India recorded its highest Navratri sales in over 10 years, driven by a combination of festive demand and the NextGen GST reforms, according to government sources.\n\nThe rationalisation of GST slabs and targeted measures to make essential and aspirational goods more accessible have significantly boosted consumer confidence, resulting in record-breaking consumption across key sectors, they said.\n\nGST reforms under the Modi government have lowered the tax burden on the middle class and unlocked aspirations across India. This Navratri has validated the impact of these reforms on the ground, a senior government official said.\n\nIndia has adopted a simplified two-tier tax system, effective from September 22, under which the majority of goods and services are taxed at 5 and 18, instead of the four tax slabs previously in place. A 40 tax is levied on ultra-luxury items.\n\nThe auto industry was among the biggest beneficiaries. Maruti Suzuki reported its best-ever Navratri performance in a decade, with deliveries crossing 2 lakh vehicles, and bookings hitting 3.5 lakh. On the first day of Navratri alone, it delivered a record 30,000 cars--its highest in 35 years.\n\nMahindra & Mahindra saw a 60 per cent year-on-year increase in retail sales, driven by high demand for the XUV700 and Scorpio N. Hyundai SUV sales also surged, with models like Creta and Venue pushing SUVs to over 72 per cent of its total sales. Tata Motors retailed over 50,000 vehicles, while Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto reported strong growth, especially in the commuter and two-wheeler segments.\n\nIn the consumer electronics space, brands reported double-digit to near triple-digit growth. Haier sales rose 85 per cent, nearly exhausting its Diwali inventory of premium large-screen TVs. Reliance Retail experienced a 20-25 per cent increase in sales, driven by categories such as smartphones, fashion, and TVs. Vijay Sales and LG India also reported strong growth, attributing momentum to festive offers and GST-driven price stability.\n\nGovernment sources highlighted that the first half of the festive season--Onam to Dussehra--typically accounts for 40-45 per cent of annual festive sales, making it the largest consumption period in India. With brands and retailers clocking 25 per cent to 100 per cent growth, this season underscores India strength as a consumption-driven economy, bolstered by proactive fiscal policy and structural tax reforms.

    "Explanation": "India witnessed its highest Navratri sales in a decade, thanks to increased festive demand and GST reforms. Simplified tax slabs have boosted consumer confidence, culminating in record consumption. The auto industry and electronics sector led the surge, affirming India's status as a consumption-driven economy.\n\nIndia has recorded its highest Navratri sales in over a decade, driven significantly by a combination of robust festive demand and recent GST reforms, government sources revealed. The rationalisation of GST slabs and targeted measures to enhance the accessibility of essential and aspirational goods have considerably bolstered consumer confidence, resulting in record-breaking consumption across key sectors, they reported.\n\n\"GST reforms under the Modi government have lowered the tax burden on the middle class and unlocked aspirations across India. This Navratri has validated the impact of these reforms on the ground,\" a senior government official stated. India adopted a streamlined two-tier tax system effective from September 22, consolidating most goods and services under 5% and 18% tax brackets, departing from the previous four-slab system, while ultra-luxury items incur a 40% tax.\n\nThe automotive sector emerged as a substantial beneficiary. Maruti Suzuki reported their best Navratri performance in a decade, exceeding 2 lakh vehicle deliveries, and achieving 3.5 lakh bookings. On the first day of Navratri alone, a record 30,000 units were delivered, marking its highest in 35 years. Mahindra & Mahindra enjoyed a 60% year-on-year retail sales surge, notably due to the XUV700 and Scorpio N demand. Hyundai's SUV sales soared with models such as Creta and Venue accounting for over 72% of total sales. Tata Motors sold over 50,000 vehicles, while Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto reported impressive growth, particularly in the commuter and two-wheeler segments.\n\nIn the consumer electronics arena, brands experienced double-digit to near triple-digit growth. Haier's sales surged 85%, nearly depleting its Diwali stock of premium large-screen TVs. Reliance Retail saw a 20-25% sales increase, driven by smartphones, fashion, and televisions. Vijay Sales and LG India also reported robust growth, attributing momentum to festive deals and GST-driven price stability. Government sources highlighted that the first half of the festive period -- from Onam to Dussehra -- typically accounts for 40-45% of annual festive sales, marking it as India's largest consumption phase. Brands and retailers recording 25% to 100% growth emphasize the nation's strength as a consumption-driven economy, supported by proactive fiscal policy and structural tax reforms.",

    "Title": "Modi Govt's NextGen GST Reforms Propel India's Consumer Economy To Decade-High Navratri Sales",
    "Explanation": "India's consumer economy achieved its highest Navratri sales in over a decade, driven by record consumption across the automobile and consumer electronics sectors. This unprecedented surge is attributed to the Narendra Modi government's NextGen GST reforms, which rationalised tax rates, lowered product prices, and significantly boosted consumer confidence and aspirations.\n\nThe tax relief has empowered families to spend more freely, leading to record-breaking upgrades in vehicles and home appliances.\n\nThe automotive industry experienced an unparalleled sales momentum, with several major manufacturers reporting their best-ever Navratri performance:\n\nMaruti Suzuki: Sales doubled from last year, marking the best-ever Navratri in at least a decade. The company delivered a massive batch of 1.65 lakh vehicles in the first eight days. On Day 1 of Navratri, Maruti delivered a record 30,000 cars, its best single-day performance in 35 years. Total bookings stand at 3.5 lakh, with nearly 2.5 lakh pending deliveries.\n\nMahindra & Mahindra: Retails for its popular SUV models, including the XUV700 and Scorpio N, jumped by 60% year-on-year.\n\nHyundai: A surge in demand for the Creta and Venue pushed the share of SUVs in total sales to over 72%.\n\nTata Motors: The company retailed more than 50,000 vehicles, fueled by strong demand for models like the Altroz, Punch, Nexon, and Tiago.\n\nTwo-Wheelers: Hero MotoCorp reported that showroom footfalls doubled, with high traction noted in the crucial commuter segment. Bajaj Auto also registered strong sales.\n\nThe consumer electronics and appliance space recorded high double-digit sales growth, with retailers reporting an exceptional appetite for large, aspirational products:\n\nHaier: Sales soared by 85%. The company nearly sold out its entire Diwali stock of high-end 85-inch and 100-inch TVs (priced above Rs 2.5 lakh) and sold 300-350 units of 65-inch TVs daily.\n\nReliance Retail: India's largest retailer saw sales grow by 20-25% over last year's Navratri period, driven by momentum in large-screen TVs, smartphones, and fashion.\n\nLG Electronics India: The company noted \"exponential growth\" in sales for the Navratri season.\n\nVijay Sales: The electronics retail chain also recorded a sales growth exceeding 20%.\n\nThe rationalisation of GST slabs by the government, which eased the tax burden on aspirational and essential goods, has successfully fostered an environment of confident spending. As a result, brands and retailers reported sales growth ranging from 25% to 100%, delivering a major boost to India's consumption-driven economy.",

    "Title": "India records highest navratri sales in a decade, powered by GST reforms: Govt sources",
    "Explanation": "New Delhi [India] October 3 (ANI): India recorded its highest Navratri sales in over 10 years, driven by a combination of festive demand and the NextGen GST reforms, according to government sources.\n\nThe rationalisation of GST slabs and targeted measures to make essential and aspirational goods more accessible have significantly boosted consumer confidence, resulting in record-breaking consumption across key sectors, they said.\n\n\"GST reforms under the Modi government have lowered the tax burden on the middle class and unlocked aspirations across India. This Navratri has validated the impact of these reforms on the ground,\" a senior government official said.\n\nIndia has adopted a simplified two-tier tax system, effective from September 22, under which the majority of goods and services are taxed at 5% and 18%, instead of the four tax slabs previously in place. A 40% tax is levied on ultra-luxury items.\n\nThe auto industry was among the biggest beneficiaries. Maruti Suzuki reported its best-ever Navratri performance in a decade, with deliveries crossing 2 lakh vehicles, and bookings hitting 3.5 lakh. On the first day of Navratri alone, it delivered a record 30,000 cars--its highest in 35 years.\n\nMahindra & Mahindra saw a 60 per cent year-on-year increase in retail sales, driven by high demand for the XUV700 and Scorpio N. Hyundai's SUV sales also surged, with models like Creta and Venue pushing SUVs to over 72 per cent of its total sales. Tata Motors retailed over 50,000 vehicles, while Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto reported strong growth, especially in the commuter and two-wheeler segments.\n\nIn the consumer electronics space, brands reported double-digit to near triple-digit growth. Haier's sales rose 85 per cent, nearly exhausting its Diwali inventory of premium large-screen TVs. Reliance Retail experienced a 20-25 per cent increase in sales, driven by categories such as smartphones, fashion, and TVs. Vijay Sales and LG India also reported strong growth, attributing momentum to festive offers and GST-driven price stability.\n\nGovernment sources highlighted that the first half of the festive season--Onam to Dussehra--typically accounts for 40-45 per cent of annual festive sales, making it the largest consumption period in India. With brands and retailers clocking 25 per cent to 100 per cent growth, this season underscores India's strength as a consumption-driven economy, bolstered by proactive fiscal policy and structural tax reforms.

      "title": "India records highest navratri sales in a decade, powered by GST reforms: Govt sources",
      "body": "New Delhi [India] October 3 (ANI): India recorded its highest Navratri sales in over 10 years, driven by a combination of festive demand and the NextGen GST reforms, according to government sources.\n\nThe rationalisation of GST slabs and targeted measures to make essential and aspirational goods more accessible have significantly boosted consumer confidence, resulting in record-breaking consumption across key sectors, they said.\n\n\"GST reforms under the Modi government have lowered the tax burden on the middle class and unlocked aspirations across India. This Navratri has validated the impact of these reforms on the ground,\" a senior government official said.\n\nIndia has adopted a simplified two-tier tax system, effective from September 22, under which the majority of goods and services are taxed at 5% and 18%, instead of the four tax slabs previously in place. A 40% tax is levied on ultra-luxury items.\n\nThe auto industry was among the biggest beneficiaries. Maruti Suzuki reported its best-ever Navratri performance in a decade, with deliveries crossing 2 lakh vehicles, and bookings hitting 3.5 lakh. On the first day of Navratri alone, it delivered a record 30,000 cars--its highest in 35 years.\n\nMahindra & Mahindra saw a 60 per cent year-on-year increase in retail sales, driven by high demand for the XUV700 and Scorpio N. Hyundai's SUV sales also surged, with models like Creta and Venue pushing SUVs to over 72 per cent of its total sales. Tata Motors retailed over 50,000 vehicles, while Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto reported strong growth, especially in the commuter and two-wheeler segments.\n\nIn the consumer electronics space, brands reported double-digit to near triple-digit growth. Haier's sales rose 85 per cent, nearly exhausting its Diwali inventory of premium large-screen TVs. Reliance Retail experienced a 20-25 per cent increase in sales, driven by categories such as smartphones, fashion, and TVs. Vijay Sales and LG India also reported strong growth, attributing momentum to festive offers and GST-driven price stability.\n\nGovernment sources highlighted that the first half of the festive season--Onam to Dussehra--typically accounts for 40-45 per cent of annual festive sales, making it the largest consumption period in India. With brands and retailers clocking 25 per cent to 100 per cent growth, this season underscores India's strength as a consumption-driven economy, bolstered by proactive fiscal policy and structural tax reforms.

    "Title": "PM Modi's GST 2.0 Diwali gift sends Navratri sales soaring to a decade-high",
    "Explanation": "This Navratri, India's festive economy touched new highs, marking its strongest festive sales in more than 10 years, fueled by strong festive demand and the Modi government's recent GST reforms. It cut tax rates across essential and aspirational goods, making products more affordable and fueling consumer demand.\n\nFrom cars and SUVs to home appliances and electronics, almost every major sector witnessed unmatched growth during the nine-day festival.\n\nAutomobile sector breaks records\n\nThe automobile industry emerged as the biggest winner this festive season. Maruti Suzuki recorded its best-ever Navratri sales growth by 100 per cent in at least a decade, with bookings doubling from last year. The firm reported 1.5 lakh bookings and expected to rise to 2 lakh bookings, compared to 85,000 vehicles retailed last Navratri.\n\nIn a historic record, Maruti Suzuki delivered 1.65 lakh cars in the first eight days, including 30,000 cars on the first day of Navratri alone, which was its best single-day performance in 35 years.\n\nCompetitive brands also rode the festive wave like Mahindra & Mahindra saw retail sales jump 60 per cent year-on-year, driven by SUVs like the XUV700 and Scorpio N.\n\nAt Hyundai, the increased demand for models like Creta and Venue pushed SUV's share accounting for over 72 per cent of its total sales.\n\nHero MotoCorp doubled showroom footfalls, while Tata Motors retailed over 50,000 vehicles, driven by Altroz, Punch, Nexon and Tiago.\n\nConsumer Electronics in demand\n\nHaier India recorded a staggering 85 per cent sales jump, nearly selling out its Diwali stock of premium 85-inch and 100-inch TVs priced about Rs 2.5 lakh. The firm also sold 300-500 units of 65-inch TVs daily during the period.\n\nIndia's largest retailer Reliance Retails grew by 20-25 per cent over last year's Navratri, showing this outstanding performance with categories like large-screen TVs, smartphones, and fashion driving the sales momentum.\n\nWhereas, electronics retail chain Vijay sales saw a more than 20 per cent sales growth. On the other hand LG Electronics also noted \"exponential growth \"across categories.\n\nGST cuts fuel confident spending\n\nThe government encouraged an environment of confident spending, by rationalising GST slabs and easing the tax burden on both essential and aspirational items.\n\nAs a result, the brands and retailers reported sales growth ranging from 25 per cent to 100 per cent that marks a major boost for India's consumption-driven economy.\n\nWith the first half of the festive season covering Onam, Durga Puja and Dussehra, already accounting for 40-45 per cent of annual festive sales, retailers expect Diwali and Christmas to push consumption to new all-time highs.",

    "Title": "India logs highest Navratri sales in a decade as GST cuts fuel record festive demand",
    "Explanation": "Automobile and consumer electronics makers report sales growth of 25-100% during Navratri, with Maruti Suzuki and Haier leading the surge, government sources said.\n\nIndia's consumer economy has clocked its highest Navratri sales in over 10 years, boosted by the Modi government's NextGen GST reforms that lowered tax rates and made products more accessible, according to government sources.\n\nThe rationalisation of GST slabs eased the tax burden across essential and aspirational items, spurring confident spending. Families upgraded cars, home appliances and lifestyle goods, driving a surge in demand that brands described as record-breaking.\n\nAutomobile sector: Maruti sets historic benchmark\n\nAutomakers were among the biggest winners this Navratri.\n\nMaruti Suzuki reported its best-ever Navratri performance in at least a decade, with sales doubling year-on-year. The company secured 150,000 bookings and expects to touch 200,000 bookings, compared to 85,000 vehicles retailed last Navratri. It delivered 1.65 lakh vehicles in the first eight days of the festival, including a record 30,000 cars on Day 1 alone, marking the company's best single-day performance in 35 years, government sources said.\n\nMahindra & Mahindra, which sells popular SUVs like the XUV700 and Scorpio N, posted a 60 percent jump in retails year-on-year.\n\nAt Hyundai, strong demand for Creta and Venue pushed SUVs to over 72 percent of total sales, government sources added.\n\nHero MotoCorp saw showroom footfalls double this Navratri, with particularly strong traction in the commuter two-wheeler segment.\n\nTata Motors retailed more than 50,000 vehicles, led by Altroz, Punch, Nexon and Tiago models.\n\nBajaj Auto also reported robust festive sales, according to government sources.\n\nConsumer electronics: Haier, LG and Reliance lead surge\n\nThe electronics segment also saw booming demand, with brands posting high double-digit growth.\n\nHaier's sales soared 85%, nearly exhausting its Diwali stock of 85-inch and 100-inch TVs priced above Rs 2.5 lakh. The company sold 300-350 units of 65-inch TVs daily during Navratri.\n\nLG Electronics India reported \"exponential growth\" across its product lines.\n\nReliance Retail, India's largest retailer, saw 20-25 percent growth year-on-year, with large-screen TVs, smartphones and fashion categories leading sales momentum, government sources said.\n\nElectronics retailer Vijay Sales reported more than 20 percent growth in sales.\n\nGodrej Appliances also saw high double-digit growth this Navratri.\n\nFestive economy outlook\n\nWith brands and retailers reporting sales growth between 25 percent and 100 percent, the first half of India's festive season, spanning Onam, Durga Puja and Dussehra, has emerged as the largest consumption window of the year, accounting for 40-45 percent of total festive sales, according to government sources.\n\nThe record-breaking Navratri demand underscores how GST cuts have translated into higher affordability and stronger consumer sentiment, giving India's consumption-driven economy a powerful festive boost.",

    "Title": "Navratri Sales Of Consumer Goods Surge To 10-Year High As GST Cuts Boost Demand",
    "Explanation": "New Delhi, Oct 3: India's economy witnessed its highest Navratri sales of consumer goods in over a decade, propelled by the government's next-gen GST reforms that reduced tax rates and made products more affordable for the consumers.\n\nGST Cuts Unlock Consumer Aspirations\n\nThese measures not only lowered prices but also unlocked consumer aspirations, enabling families to upgrade vehicles, invest in home appliances, and spend more freely on lifestyle goods, turning festive cheer into record-breaking consumption, as per the data.\n\nMaruti Suzuki Leads the Boom\n\nLeading car maker Maruti Suzuki clocked a 100 per cent growth in Navratri, which doubled from last year -- best-ever in at least a decade. Maruti Suzuki reported 150,000 bookings and expects to reach 200,000 bookings. The company retailed 85,000 vehicles last Navratri.\n\nRecord Deliveries in Automobile Sector\n\nThe automobile market leader also delivered a massive batch of 1.65 lakh vehicles in the first 8 days of Navratri. On Day 1 of Navratri, Maruti delivered record 30,000 cars, its best single-day performance in 35 years.\n\nOther Automakers See Strong Demand\n\nHomegrown auto major Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, which sells popular SUVs such as the XUV700, Thar and Scorpio N, saw sales jump 60 per cent year-on-year.\n\nAt Hyundai, the surge in demand for models like Creta and Venue pushed SUVs' share of total sales to over 72 per cent, as per the data.\n\nTata Motors retailed more than 50,000 vehicles during the festive period, with demand from Altroz, Punch, Nexon and Tiago models.\n\nTwo-Wheeler Sales Also Double\n\nShowroom footfalls of two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp have doubled this Navratri with high traction in the commuter segment while arch rival Bajaj Auto also reported strong sales during Navratri.\n\nConsumer Electronics Register Exponential Growth\n\nIn consumer electronics space, LG, Haier, and Godrej Appliances reported high double-digit sales growth this Navratri compared to last year.\n\nHaier's sales soared 85 per cent, nearly selling out its Diwali stock of 85-inch and 100-inch TVs priced above Rs 2.5 lakh. The company also sold 300-350 units of 65-inch TVs daily during the period. LG Electronics India noted \"exponential growth\" in sales this Navratri season.\n\nFestive Consumption Gets Major Boost\n\nBy rationalising GST slabs and easing the tax burden on both essential and aspirational items, the government fostered an environment of confident spending. As a result, brands and retailers reported sales growth ranging from 25 per cent to 100 per cent, marking a major boost for India's consumption-driven economy.\n\nAlso Watch:\n\nFestive Season Accounts for Nearly Half of Sales\n\nImportantly, the first half of the festive season, spanning Onam, Durga Puja, and Dussehra accounts for 40-45 per cent of total festive sales making it the largest consumption season in the country.",

On Day 1 of Navratri, Maruti delivered record 30,000 cars, its best single-day performance in 35 years.\n\nOther Automakers See Strong Demand\n\nHomegrown auto major Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, which sells popular SUVs such as the XUV700, Thar and Scorpio N, saw sales jump 60 per cent year-on-year.\n\nAt Hyundai, the surge in demand for models like Creta and Venue pushed SUVs' share of total sales to over 72 per cent, as per the data.\n\nTata Motors retailed more than 50,000 vehicles during the festive period, with demand from Altroz, Punch, Nexon and Tiago models.\n\nTwo-Wheeler Sales Also Double\n\nShowroom footfalls of two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp have doubled this Navratri with high traction in the commuter segment while arch rival Bajaj Auto also reported strong sales during Navratri.\n\nConsumer Electronics Register Exponential Growth\n\nIn consumer electronics space, LG, Haier, and Godrej Appliances reported high double-digit sales growth this Navratri compared to last year.\n\nHaier's sales soared 85 per cent, nearly selling out its Diwali stock of 85-inch and 100-inch TVs priced above Rs 2.5 lakh. The company also sold 300-350 units of 65-inch TVs daily during the period. LG Electronics India noted \"exponential growth\" in sales this Navratri season.\n\nFestive Consumption Gets Major Boost\n\nBy rationalising GST slabs and easing the tax burden on both essential and aspirational items, the government fostered an environment of confident spending. As a result, brands and retailers reported sales growth ranging from 25 per cent to 100 per cent, marking a major boost for India's consumption-driven economy.\n\nAlso Watch:\n\nFestive Season Accounts for Nearly Half of Sales\n\nImportantly, the first half of the festive season, spanning Onam, Durga Puja, and Dussehra accounts for 40-45 per cent of total festive sales making it the largest consumption season in the country.",

    "Title": "Jaguar Land Rover on state life support after cyberattack",
    "Explanation": "Why is the state taking action? Because the risk is systemic. JLR, owned by India's Tata Motors, has 34,000 direct employees, 120,000 more in the supply chain, and nearly one in three vehicles assembled in the UK last year -- just behind Nissan. When such a major player shuts down for a month, the disruption spreads like wildfire: behind the tier 1 suppliers are tiers 2, 3, and 4 with tiny cash reserves, which also supply other manufacturers. The cyberattack forced the group to shut down its systems and production. The cost of this shutdown amounts to £50m (€57.2m) per week in lost production, according to the BBC.\n\nHence the urgent need for a financial bridge. In concrete terms, JLR is finalizing a loan from HSBC, MUFG, and NatWest, backed by the UKEF guarantee. At the same time, the group has already secured a £2bn credit line from Standard Chartered Bank, Citigroup, and MUFG. The goal is to replenish working capital, pay in advance for components usually purchased on credit, and restart the pump.\n\nWhat we know -- and don't know -- about the attack. On September 2, JLR shut down its IT systems and acknowledged a \"cyber incident.\" Since then, neither the company nor its parent company has provided any technical details: entry point, malware, exfiltration? Radio silence. All that remains are strange claims and rumors published online. On Telegram, a group calling itself Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters published screenshots in early September that they claimed were from JLR's internal systems.\n\nAt KELA's Cyber Intelligence Center, caution is the order of the day: as long as no victims confirm the claims and no databases have been exfiltrated and exposed, the default position remains skepticism. Why are these aliases causing such a stir? Because they are playing with very real ghosts. Lapsus$, now silent, has made some resounding hits: Uber (2022), Rockstar Games (2023). Their signature? Total control of networks, deployment of ransomware, organized paralysis... and a bill in bitcoins. Their entry point? Social engineering, the art of tricking an employee over the phone, by email, or by text message, until they get the key that unlocks the infrastructure. Their profile?\n\nLet's return to JLR with one certainty that has emerged: the manufacturer did not have cyber insurance at the time of the incident. This has fueled criticism of digital risk preparedness and management, as the economic cost continues to rise.\n\nIn financial terms, the mechanics of the guarantee are well known. UKEF does not lend money: the public agency grants banks a partial guarantee -- up to 80% of the risk -- on cash or investment loans granted to a major exporter. Taxpayers are only exposed in the event of default, a risk that analysts consider \"unlikely.\" In exchange, UKEF charges a risk premium, which is included in the interest rate paid by the borrower. The precise terms remain confidential, as is always the case with these matters. This is not the UK's first attempt: in July, Ford obtained an £800m UKEF guarantee on a £1bn loan for its transition to electric vehicles; meanwhile, SeAH Wind UK received £590m for an offshore wind farm in Teesside in 2023-24. The logic of strategic interest: where banks hesitate, the state steps in.\n\nHowever, the operation is not without controversy. Economists are waving the flag of \"moral hazard\": if the public backstop becomes predictable, other companies could decide not to insure themselves against cyber risks or take a more lax approach to risk management, counting on a bailout.\n\nWhat now? If the line covered by UKEF closes as planned, JLR should first pay its Tier 1 partners in cash. But at the bottom of the pyramid, the pain remains. Moody's has downgraded the outlook for parent company Tata Motors from positive to negative, estimating that a return to normal \"will likely take several months.\"\n\nFor JLR, the cyber shock comes on top of an already difficult situation. In 2024, the group sold around 430,000 vehicles, but 2025 began with a tariff wall on the US side: customs duties decided by Donald Trump, initially 27.5%, then 10% after an agreement between London and Washington. In April, faced with this tax, JLR suspended deliveries to the US market. At the beginning of July, quarterly volumes were down sharply: demand shifted, the mix deteriorated, and the US lever -- a key high-margin market -- was no longer working.\n\nThen came the social cost. A few days later, the manufacturer announced up to 500 management job cuts in the UK, representing 1.5% of its British workforce. This is a classic sign of a cost crisis: when market access prices rise and systems falter, the structure is streamlined to save cash flow.\n\nA month after the shock, the equation remains the same: an opaque cyberattack, an exposed industry, and a government acting as a buffer. It remains to be seen whether public oxygen will be enough to restart the machine... and whether the lesson -- risk governance, insurance, digital hygiene -- will truly be learned.",

It remains to be seen whether public oxygen will be enough to restart the machine... and whether the lesson -- risk governance, insurance, digital hygiene -- will truly be learned.",

    "Title": "Tata Motors Sells Record 60,907 Cars In September - EV & CNG Sales Double",
    "Explanation": "Tata Motors set a new benchmark in September 2025, reporting its highest-ever monthly passenger vehicle sales. Tata Motors sold 60,907 passenger vehicles last month, including 59,667 units in the domestic market, registering a massive 45.3 per cent year-on-year increase.\n\nExports played a role in this record as well, with 1,240 units shipped overseas compared to just 250 units in the same month last year. That surge reflects a 396 per cent rise and underlines Tata's growing presence in international markets.\n\nTogether, green fuel models (EV + CNG) made up 44 per cent of Tata's overall sales in the quarter. This aligns with the company's broader strategy of offering multiple sustainable powertrain options across its lineup.\n\nIn model-wise performance, the Nexon emerged as the leader with over 22,500 units sold in September - its best-ever single month. Meanwhile, the Harrier and Safari achieved their strongest combined sales, helped by the introduction of the new Adventure X edition.\n\nThe industry-wide GST 2.0 rollout and the festive season provided a clear boost. New tax structures brought down effective prices in some categories, encouraging faster decision-making among buyers and lifting footfalls in showrooms nationwide.\n\nTata Motors Sales - September 2025\n\nShailesh Chandra, Managing Director, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles said,\n\n\"The passenger vehicles industry marked a sharp upswing in demand during September 2025 following the rollout of GST 2.0, further buoyed by festive tailwinds. This surge in demand sets a promising tone for sustained growth in the months ahead. September 2025 emerged as a watershed month with sales of 60,907 units (domestic wholesales of 59,667 units), our highest ever, marking a substantial 47% year-on-year growth. EV sales surged 96%+ while CNG sales reached an all-time high of over 17,800 units.\"\n\nThe momentum was visible in the quarter results, too. Tata's Q2 FY26 PV sales stood at 144,397 units, up 10.4 per cent year-on-year. Domestic numbers hit 140,189 units, while exports climbed to 4,208 units with 411 per cent growth.\n\nThis record surge also altered market rankings. Tata Motors has now climbed to second spot in India's auto market, overtaking Hyundai and Mahindra.",

    "Explanation": "Tata Motors' strong SUV and EV sales helped it reclaim the No. 2 spot in India's passenger vehicle market, with September registrations rising 28%, while overall EV adoption more than doubled, highlighting the company's growing dominance in the electric mobility segment.\n\nTata Motors shares are set to be in the spotlight on Friday, October 3, after reclaiming the No. 2 position in India's passenger vehicle (PV) market by overtaking Hyundai Motor India and Mahindra & Mahindra in September registrations.\n\nThe company's strong showing was powered by robust sales of its SUVs and electric vehicles. Further, Tata Motors also widened its lead over JSW MG Motor in the electric vehicle segment, according to data from the government's Vahan portal.\n\nMaruti Suzuki continues to hold the top position.\n\nTata Motors recorded 40,594 PV registrations in September, including EVs, marking a 28 per cent rise from 31,581 units a year ago. Hyundai, which held the No. 2 spot last year, slipped to fourth with 35,443 registrations (down from 37,666), while Mahindra stood at third with 37,015 units.\n\nMarket leader Maruti Suzuki registered 122,278 units, up from 113,560 last year.\n\nTata's ascent was driven by models like the Nexon, Punch, and Harrier in the internal combustion segment, alongside strong demand for its electric offerings, Nexon EV, Tiago EV, and Punch EV, which contributed an estimated 13-15 per cent of total volumes.\n\nOverall EV registrations more than doubled year-on-year to 15,040 units in September, from 6,210 units last year.\n\nNew players like Tesla and Vinfast also joined the fray, recording 60 and six units respectively. Tata Motors retained a dominant position with an estimated 70 per cent share of the mass EV market, significantly ahead of MG's EV volumes.\n\nWhile Hyundai's slide reflects slower growth in models like the Creta and Venue and limited traction in its premium EVs such as Ioniq 5, Mahindra maintained third place with its SUV lineup (Scorpio-N, Bolero, XUV700, and Thar), though it is yet to make a significant entry into the mass EV segment.\n\nThe September numbers were influenced by seasonal factors such as the early onset of Navratri (September 22-October 2), the Shraddh period, and recent GST cuts on small cars, which bunched up registrations toward the end of the month. Still, Tata Motors' resurgence in both the PV and EV space marks a significant development that could keep investor focus on the stock heading into the weekend.",

    "Title": "Closing bell: Sensex up by 224 points, Nifty at 24,894.25; Tata Steel leads, Max Healthcare as top laggard",
    "Explanation": "Tata Steel emerged as a top performer in today's trade, as it rose by 3.45%, with its shares closing at Rs173.29. It was followed by Power Grid Cooperation of India, which advanced by 2.85%, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Axis Bank too joined the top five spot, by rising more than 2%. Larsen and Toubro took the fifth spot, adding nearly 2% to its previous closing.\n\n2025 is shaping up to be the year of electric car sales.

    "Title": "IPO-bound Tata Capital bets on green energy financing, tech push for growth",
    "Explanation": "Tata Capital will launch its initial public offering next week. The company focuses on green financing and digital innovation. Its cleantech finance book reached 18,000 crore rupees. This book grew over two years. The company aims for long-term growth. It uses the Tata brand. India's economy offers expansion potential. Capital adequacy is projected at 22 percent post-IPO.\n\nKolkata, Tata Capital Ltd, set to launch its IPO next week, has identified green financing and digital innovation as its core growth pillars, backed by the merger of its IFC-backed subsidiary Tata Cleantech Capital in 2024.\n\nBy FY25, the cleantech and infrastructure finance book reached Rs 18,000 crore, growing at a 31.8 per cent CAGR over the last two years, the NBFC said on Friday.\n\n\"Over the last decade, the cleantech portfolio has financed over 500 renewable projects and sanctioned more than 22,400 MW of capacity across solar, wind, biomass, small hydro, among others,\" MD and CEO Rajiv Sabharwal said.\n\n\"The cleantech segment combines rapid growth with high-quality, secured assets, underpinned by technology-driven monitoring and disciplined underwriting. The portfolio is among the cleanest in the NBFC space, positioning the company as a key mobilizer of global climate capital,\" he said.\n\nThe Tata Group NBFC said it is building for the long term with a vision anchored on trust, customer-centricity, and responsible partnership.\n\nLeveraging the Tata brand, it aims to become a financial leader while ensuring stability across cycles.\n\nSpeaking about growth outlook, Sabharwal said, \"India's high growth pace and relatively low credit penetration offer strong expansion potential.\n\nNBFCs, with their nimbleness in technology adoption and branch rollouts, are outpacing overall credit growth. Its loan book has accelerated, led by housing (one-third of growth), consumer lending, and SMEs - the backbone of the economy.\"\n\nThe company stated it underscored its granular loan book, low unsecured exposure, and multi-product strategy to balance growth and risk. However, post the Tata Motors Finance acquisition, net NPA stands at 1 per cent, while excluding it, the figure is 0.6 per cent. Capital adequacy is expected at 22 per cent post-IPO, Tata Capital CFO Rakesh Bhatia said.\n\nChief Operating Officer Abonty Banerjee said the company has deployed GenAI in underwriting for working capital loans, which it said has dramatically reduced turnaround time for credit appraisal memos.\n\nWith India's 2070 net-zero target offering a massive runway for green financing, Tata Capital said it is uniquely placed to support the country's energy transition while presenting a strong investment case to IPO investors.\n\nThe IPO will open on October 6 with a price band of Rs 310-Rs 326 per equity share and a minimum lot size of 46 shares. The company aims to raise over Rs 15,500 crore from the issue. PTI",

    "Title": "Navratri Sales Of Consumer Goods Surge To 10-Year High As GST Cuts Boost Demand",
    "Explanation": "New Delhi: India's economy witnessed its highest Navratri sales of consumer goods in over a decade, propelled by the government's next-gen GST reforms that reduced tax rates and made products more affordable for the consumers.\n\nThese measures not only lowered prices but also unlocked consumer aspirations, enabling families to upgrade vehicles, invest in home appliances, and spend more freely on lifestyle goods, turning festive cheer into record-breaking consumption, as per the data.\n\nLeading car maker Maruti Suzuki clocked a 100 per cent growth in Navratri, which doubled from last year -- best-ever in at least a decade. Maruti Suzuki reported 150,000 bookings and expects to reach 200,000 bookings. The company retailed 85,000 vehicles last Navratri.\n\nThe automobile market leader also delivered a massive batch of 1.65 lakh vehicles in the first 8 days of Navratri. On Day 1 of Navratri, Maruti delivered record 30,000 cars, its best single-day performance in 35 years. Homegrown auto major Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, which sells popular SUVs such as the XUV700, Thar and Scorpio N, saw sales jump 60 per cent year-on-year.\n\nAt Hyundai, the surge in demand for models like Creta and Venue pushed SUVs' share of total sales to over 72 per cent, as per the data. Tata Motors retailed more than 50,000 vehicles during the festive period, with demand from Altroz, Punch, Nexon and Tiago models.\n\nShowroom footfalls of two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp have doubled this Navratri with high traction in the commuter segment while arch rival Bajaj Auto also reported strong sales during Navratri. In consumer electronics space, LG, Haier, and Godrej Appliances reported high double-digit sales growth this Navratri compared to last year.\n\nHaier's sales soared 85 per cent, nearly selling out its Diwali stock of 85-inch and 100-inch TVs priced above Rs 2.5 lakh. The company also sold 300-350 units of 65-inch TVs daily during the period. LG Electronics India noted \"exponential growth\" in sales this Navratri season.\n\nBy rationalising GST slabs and easing the tax burden on both essential and aspirational items, the government fostered an environment of confident spending. As a result, brands and retailers reported sales growth ranging from 25 per cent to 100 per cent, marking a major boost for India's consumption-driven economy.\n\nImportantly, the first half of the festive season, spanning Onam, Durga Puja, and Dussehra accounts for 40-45 per cent of total festive sales making it the largest consumption season in the country.",

    "Title": "Navratri sales of consumer goods surge to 10-year high as GST cuts boost demand",
    "Explanation": "New Delhi, Oct 3 (SocialNews.XYZ) India's economy witnessed its highest Navratri sales of consumer goods in over a decade, propelled by the government's next-gen GST reforms that reduced tax rates and made products more affordable for the consumers.\n\nThese measures not only lowered prices but also unlocked consumer aspirations, enabling families to upgrade vehicles, invest in home appliances, and spend more freely on lifestyle goods, turning festive cheer into record-breaking consumption, as per the data.\n\nLeading car maker Maruti Suzuki clocked a 100 per cent growth in Navratri, which doubled from last year -- best-ever in at least a decade. Maruti Suzuki reported 150,000 bookings and expects to reach 200,000 bookings. The company retailed 85,000 vehicles last Navratri.\n\nThe automobile market leader also delivered a massive batch of 1.65 lakh vehicles in the first 8 days of Navratri. On Day 1 of Navratri, Maruti delivered record 30,000 cars, its best single-day performance in 35 years.\n\nHomegrown auto major Mahindra & Mahindra, which sells popular SUVs such as the XUV700, Thar and Scorpio N, saw sales jump 60 per cent year-on-year.\n\nAt Hyundai, the surge in demand for models like Creta and Venue pushed SUVs' share of total sales to over 72 per cent, as per the data.\n\nTata Motors retailed more than 50,000 vehicles during the festive period, with demand from Altroz, Punch, Nexon and Tiago models.\n\nShowroom footfalls of two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp have doubled this Navratri with high traction in the commuter segment while arch rival Bajaj Auto also reported strong sales during Navratri.\n\nIn consumer electronics space, LG, Haier, and Godrej Appliances reported high double-digit sales growth this Navratri compared to last year.\n\nHaier's sales soared 85 per cent, nearly selling out its Diwali stock of 85-inch and 100-inch TVs priced above Rs 2.5 lakh. The company also sold 300-350 units of 65-inch TVs daily during the period. LG Electronics India noted \"exponential growth\" in sales this Navratri season.\n\nBy rationalising GST slabs and easing the tax burden on both essential and aspirational items, the government fostered an environment of confident spending. As a result, brands and retailers reported sales growth ranging from 25 per cent to 100 per cent, marking a major boost for India's consumption-driven economy.\n\nImportantly, the first half of the festive season, spanning Onam, Durga Puja, and Dussehra accounts for 40-45 per cent of total festive sales making it the largest consumption season in the country.",

    "Title": "Sept Auto Sales: Maruti leads, Hyundai drops to fourth; Nifty Auto ends flat",
    "Explanation": "The Nifty Auto index ended almost unchanged on Friday, slipping 15.55 points or 0.06 per cent to 26,753.10, as investors weighed September sales data and fresh commentary from JPMorgan, which said that for the auto sector this month, \"commentary matters more than data.\"\n\nMaruti Suzuki: In line with estimates, retail steady\n\nMaruti Suzuki India Ltd reported total sales of 1,89,665 units in September, up 2.7 per cent from 1,84,727 units last year. This came in line with Zee Business estimates of 1,89,000 units. The company hit an export record of 42,204 units, though domestic PV sales fell to 1,32,820 units from 1,44,962 last year. Shares closed 0.98 per cent lower at Rs 15,808 on the NSE.\n\nHero MotoCorp: Beats estimates, retail lag still a concern\n\nHero MotoCorp posted total sales of 6,87,220 units, up 8 per cent YoY against 6,37,050 units in September 2024, beating Zee Business estimates of 6,50,000 units. Despite wholesale strength, JPMorgan flagged Hero as \"a key laggard in retail.\" Still, the stock was the day's top auto gainer, rising 2.08 per cent to Rs 5,545.50.\n\nTVS Motor: Growth strong but below estimates\n\nTVS Motor Company sold 5,23,923 two-wheelers in September, up 11 per cent YoY from 4,71,792 units, but slightly below Zee Business estimates of 5,30,000 units. The shortfall dragged shares down 0.29 per cent to Rs 3,447.60.\n\nM&M and Tata Motors: PV leaders hold ground\n\nMahindra & Mahindra (M&M) delivered 56,233 SUV sales, up 10 per cent YoY, maintaining outperformance in both PVs and tractors. Shares were almost flat, down 0.10 per cent at Rs 3,460.\n\nTata Motors posted record monthly PV sales of 59,667 units, led by the Nexon and surging EV volumes. The stock slipped 0.35 per cent to Rs 715.85.\n\nOutlook: Festive demand to decide Q3\n\nAnalysts believe festive demand will be the decisive catalyst for auto stocks in October. With Navratri already driving strong retails, Maruti and Tata are expected to ride compact car and SUV demand, while M&M remains well-placed on SUVs and tractors. However, Hero's retail weakness and TVS's near-miss versus estimates are likely to be key monitorables.",

    "Title": "Navratri sales hit decade high, GST reforms drive festive consumption surge - The Statesman",
    "Explanation": "Festive buying surged across categories, from cars and two-wheelers to large-screen televisions and smartphones, turning Navratri into one of the most profitable sales periods in recent years.\n\nIndia's consumer economy recorded its strongest Navratri sales in more than a decade, with automobile and electronics companies reporting sharp double-digit growth.\n\nFestive buying surged across categories, from cars and two-wheelers to large-screen televisions and smartphones, turning Navratri into one of the most profitable sales periods in recent years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndustry executives attributed the buoyant demand to the Modi government's NextGen GST reforms, which lowered tax rates, reduced prices, and expanded access to aspirational goods.\n\nAccording to the data, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd led the charge, posting its best Navratri performance in at least 10 years. Sales doubled year-on-year, with the company securing 150,000 bookings so far and expecting to touch 200,000. It delivered 1.65 lakh vehicles in the first eight days, including a record 30,000 cars on the first day alone, the highest single-day tally in the company's 35-year history.\n\nRival Mahindra & Mahindra saw retail sales climb 60% year-on-year, driven by SUVs such as the XUV700 and Scorpio N. Hyundai Motor India reported that demand for the Creta and Venue pushed SUVs' share of its sales to over 72%.\n\nTwo-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp said showroom footfalls doubled this Navratri, with commuter models seeing high traction. Tata Motors retailed more than 50,000 vehicles during the festive week, powered by demand for the Altroz, Punch, Nexon and Tiago. Bajaj Auto also reported strong sales momentum.\n\nThe consumer electronics market mirrored the auto sector's festive highs. Haier India reported an 85% jump in sales, nearly exhausting its Diwali stock of premium 85-inch and 100-inch televisions priced above Rs 2.5 lakh. The company sold 300-350 units of 65-inch TVs daily during Navratri.\n\nReliance Retail, India's largest retailer, posted 20-25% growth led by large-screen TVs, smartphones and fashion. Vijay Sales also reported over 20% growth, while LG Electronics India and Godrej Appliances said they witnessed strong double-digit expansion.\n\nAccording to analysts, rationalisation of GST slabs and easing of tax burdens on both essential and aspirational items have unlocked consumer confidence, boosting discretionary spending. Overall, retailers and manufacturers reported sales growth ranging from 25% to 100% compared to last year.\n\nThe first half of the festive season, covering Onam, Durga Puja, and Dussehra, accounts for 40-45% of total festive sales, making it the largest consumption period in the country. This year's record-breaking Navratri performance signals robust momentum heading into Diwali.",

Overall, retailers and manufacturers reported sales growth ranging from 25% to 100% compared to last year.\n\nThe first half of the festive season, covering Onam, Durga Puja, and Dussehra, accounts for 40-45% of total festive sales, making it the largest consumption period in the country. This year's record-breaking Navratri performance signals robust momentum heading into Diwali.",

    "Explanation": "Kolkata, Oct 3 (PTI) Tata Capital Ltd, set to launch its IPO next week, has identified green financing and digital innovation as its core growth pillars, backed by the merger of its IFC-backed subsidiary Tata Cleantech Capital in 2024.\n\nBy FY25, the cleantech and infrastructure finance book reached Rs 18,000 crore, growing at a 31.8 per cent CAGR over the last two years, the NBFC said on Friday.\n\n\"Over the last decade, the cleantech portfolio has financed over 500 renewable projects and sanctioned more than 22,400 MW of capacity across solar, wind, biomass, small hydro, among others,\" MD and CEO Rajiv Sabharwal said.\n\n\"The cleantech segment combines rapid growth with high-quality, secured assets, underpinned by technology-driven monitoring and disciplined underwriting. The portfolio is among the cleanest in the NBFC space, positioning the company as a key mobilizer of global climate capital,\" he said.\n\nThe Tata Group NBFC said it is building for the long term with a vision anchored on trust, customer-centricity, and responsible partnership.\n\nLeveraging the Tata brand, it aims to become a financial leader while ensuring stability across cycles.\n\nSpeaking about growth outlook, Sabharwal said, \"India's high growth pace and relatively low credit penetration offer strong expansion potential.\n\nNBFCs, with their nimbleness in technology adoption and branch rollouts, are outpacing overall credit growth. Its loan book has accelerated, led by housing (one-third of growth), consumer lending, and SMEs - the backbone of the economy.\" The company stated it underscored its granular loan book, low unsecured exposure, and multi-product strategy to balance growth and risk. However, post the Tata Motors Finance acquisition, net NPA stands at 1 per cent, while excluding it, the figure is 0.6 per cent. Capital adequacy is expected at 22 per cent post-IPO, Tata Capital CFO Rakesh Bhatia said.\n\nChief Operating Officer Abonty Banerjee said the company has deployed GenAI in underwriting for working capital loans, which it said has dramatically reduced turnaround time for credit appraisal memos.\n\nWith India's 2070 net-zero target offering a massive runway for green financing, Tata Capital said it is uniquely placed to support the country's energy transition while presenting a strong investment case to IPO investors.\n\nThe IPO will open on October 6 with a price band of Rs 310-Rs 326 per equity share and a minimum lot size of 46 shares. The company aims to raise over Rs 15,500 crore from the issue. PTI BSM NN",

    "Title": "Navratri sales hit decade-high as GST reforms boost festive spending",
    "Explanation": "According to government data, several brands in the segment reported high double-digit growth.\n\nIndia's consumer economy witnessed its strongest Navratri sales in over ten years, with the recent goods and services tax (GST) reforms spurring festive demand across categories, including automobile and consumer electronics.\n\nAccording to government data, leading companies in the automobile sector, such as Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindra, Hyundai, and Tata Motors, logged record-breaking growth, with Maruti Suzuki posting 100 per cent growth in sales. Maruti reported 150,000 bookings and expects to touch 200,000, compared to 85,000 vehicles sold last Navratri.\n\nIn the first eight days of the festival, Maruti Suzuki delivered 165,000 vehicles, including 30,000 units on Day 1, making it the company's best single-day sales in 35 years. Here's how other major automakers performed:\n\n* Mahindra & Mahindra reported a 60 per cent jump in retail sales, powered by SUVs such as the XUV700 and Scorpio N\n\n* Hyundai said demand for its Creta and Venue SUVs pushed the category's share to over 72 per cent of its total sales\n\n* Tata Motors retailed over 50,000 vehicles, with strong traction for Altroz, Punch, Nexon, and Tiago\n\n* Bajaj Auto also reported robust sales momentum during the festive period\n\n* Hero MotoCorp saw showroom footfalls double this Navratri, particularly in the commuter motorcycle segment\n\nFirms log record-breaking growth\n\nThe GST rationalisation reduced tax rates on both essential and aspirational items, making products more affordable and unlocking consumer demand.\n\nALSO READ: Maruti becomes first company to transport vehicles to Kashmir through train\n\nAlso Read\n\nBest of BS Opinion: A sobering set of data reveals India's infirmities\n\nBest of BS Opinion: GST 2.0 reforms miss underlying core principles\n\nAir conditioner, TV makers upbeat about sales amid signs of GST cuts\n\nRural demand continued to outpace urban in April-June period: NielsenIQ\n\nLogistics companies gear up to meet festival season demand surgepremium\n\nConsumer electronics firms, such as Haier, recorded 85 per cent growth in sales during the festive period. LG Electronics India also noted \"exponential growth\" in sales this Navratri season. According to government data, several brands in the segment reported high double-digit growth.\n\n* Reliance Retail, the country's largest retailer, recorded a 20-25 per cent rise in sales\n\n* Haier nearly exhausted its Diwali inventory of large-screen televisions, selling 300-350 units\n\n* Vijay Sales also saw its sales rise by over 20 per cent\n\n* Godrej Appliances posted strong double-digit growth during the Navratri period\n\nFestive spending at record high\n\nRetailers and brands across categories reported sales growth ranging from 25-100 per cent, the report said, adding that it is a reflection of improved consumer sentiment and purchasing power. Industry executives said the GST reforms have not only reduced costs but also expanded accessibility for middle-class households, who are now upgrading to bigger cars, larger appliances, and premium lifestyle products.\n\nThe first half of the festive season, including Onam, Durga Puja, and Dussehra, accounts for 40-45 per cent of total festive sales, making it the single largest consumption period in India. This year, it has also become the strongest indicator yet of the resilience of India's consumption-driven economy, the report added.\n\nMore From This Section\n\nGovt extends PLI scheme application deadline for textiles sector to Dec 31\n\nCentre tells renewable energy agencies to cancel rushed solar tenders\n\nIndia's dairy sector grew by 70% in last 11 years, says Amit Shah\n\nMumbai property registrations rise 20% in Navratri 2025: Knight Frank\n\nGovt proposes national registry of online games under draft rules 2025",

    "Title": "IPO-bound Tata Capital bets on green energy financing, tech push for growth",
    "Explanation": "Kolkata, Oct 3 (PTI) Tata Capital Ltd, set to launch its IPO next week, has identified green financing and digital innovation as its core growth pillars, backed by the merger of its IFC-backed subsidiary Tata Cleantech Capital in 2024.\n\nBy FY25, the cleantech and infrastructure finance book reached Rs 18,000 crore, growing at a 31.8 per cent CAGR over the last two years, the NBFC said on Friday.\n\n\"Over the last decade, the cleantech portfolio has financed over 500 renewable projects and sanctioned more than 22,400 MW of capacity across solar, wind, biomass, small hydro, among others,\" MD and CEO Rajiv Sabharwal said.\n\n\"The cleantech segment combines rapid growth with high-quality, secured assets, underpinned by technology-driven monitoring and disciplined underwriting. The portfolio is among the cleanest in the NBFC space, positioning the company as a key mobilizer of global climate capital,\" he said.\n\nThe Tata Group NBFC said it is building for the long term with a vision anchored on trust, customer-centricity, and responsible partnership.\n\nLeveraging the Tata brand, it aims to become a financial leader while ensuring stability across cycles.\n\nSpeaking about growth outlook, Sabharwal said, \"India's high growth pace and relatively low credit penetration offer strong expansion potential.\n\nNBFCs, with their nimbleness in technology adoption and branch rollouts, are outpacing overall credit growth. Its loan book has accelerated, led by housing (one-third of growth), consumer lending, and SMEs - the backbone of the economy.\" The company stated it underscored its granular loan book, low unsecured exposure, and multi-product strategy to balance growth and risk. However, post the Tata Motors Finance acquisition, net NPA stands at 1 per cent, while excluding it, the figure is 0.6 per cent. Capital adequacy is expected at 22 per cent post-IPO, Tata Capital CFO Rakesh Bhatia said.\n\nChief Operating Officer Abonty Banerjee said the company has deployed GenAI in underwriting for working capital loans, which it said has dramatically reduced turnaround time for credit appraisal memos.\n\nWith India's 2070 net-zero target offering a massive runway for green financing, Tata Capital said it is uniquely placed to support the country's energy transition while presenting a strong investment case to IPO investors.\n\nThe IPO will open on October 6 with a price band of Rs 310-Rs 326 per equity share and a minimum lot size of 46 shares. The company aims to raise over Rs 15,500 crore from the issue. PTI BSM NN",

    "Title": "Nexon EV 45 real-life range test: How far can Tata's popular electric SUV go on a single charge?",
    "Explanation": "It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that the Tata Nexon EV has been one of the key drivers in popularising electric cars in India. Over the years, Tata Motors has continuously refined the Nexon EV, making it not only one of the most successful EVs in the country but also the best-selling model since its debut. In its latest update, the brand introduced a new top-spec version with a larger 45 kWh battery pack. With this update, the 40 kWh variant has been discontinued, although the 30 kWh entry-level option remains available. Naturally, when it comes to EVs, the most important question buyers ask is: \"How far will it go on a single charge?\" To find out, we took the Nexon EV 45 out for a real-world range test.\n\nIn our test, the Nexon EV 45 managed to deliver around 330 km on a single charge. Of course, this figure can vary based on driving style and conditions -- going downhill or driving more gently can stretch the range further, while uphill climbs or a heavy right foot will bring it down.\n\nOn paper, Tata Motors claims an MIDC range of 489 km, while the C75 rating sits between 350 and 375 km. To keep things consistent, we drove the SUV in Eco mode, using regen level 2 in city traffic and level 1 on the highways -- since the highest setting (level 3) feels too aggressive, and coasting works better on open stretches. Comfort features like air-conditioning (set at 24°C, fan speed 2-3) and the driver's ventilated seat were kept on throughout the drive.\n\nOne of the highlights of the Nexon EV 45 is its suspension setup. It does a commendable job of ironing out potholes and uneven surfaces, making city driving quite comfortable. That said, the weight of the large battery pack is noticeable, especially at higher speeds where you feel some body roll and lateral movement on long straights. This is where something like an MG Windsor EV Pro feels more confident and stable.\n\n(Also read: Living with the Tata Nexon EV for over 1,000 km. Here's what we learned)\n\nThe panoramic sunroof -- exclusive to the 45 kWh variant -- adds to the premium feel, and the inclusion of a small frunk under the hood is a practical touch for extra storage. There is also window sunshades available for the rear occupants. During our test, we did encounter a minor glitch with the instrument cluster, where the display information overlapped and became cluttered, something Tata will hopefully iron out in future updates.",

      "title": "Nexon EV 45 real-life range test: How far can Tata's popular electric SUV go on a single charge?",
      "body": "It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that the Tata Nexon EV has been one of the key drivers in popularising electric cars in India. Over the years, Tata Motors has continuously refined the Nexon EV, making it not only one of the most successful EVs in the country but also the best-selling model since its debut. In its latest update, the brand introduced a new top-spec version with a larger 45 kWh battery pack. With this update, the 40 kWh variant has been discontinued, although the 30 kWh entry-level option remains available. Naturally, when it comes to EVs, the most important question buyers ask is: \"How far will it go on a single charge?\" To find out, we took the Nexon EV 45 out for a real-world range test.\n\nIn our test, the Nexon EV 45 managed to deliver around 330 km on a single charge. Of course, this figure can vary based on driving style and conditions -- going downhill or driving more gently can stretch the range further, while uphill climbs or a heavy right foot will bring it down.\n\nOn paper, Tata Motors claims an MIDC range of 489 km, while the C75 rating sits between 350 and 375 km. To keep things consistent, we drove the SUV in Eco mode, using regen level 2 in city traffic and level 1 on the highways -- since the highest setting (level 3) feels too aggressive, and coasting works better on open stretches. Comfort features like air-conditioning (set at 24°C, fan speed 2-3) and the driver's ventilated seat were kept on throughout the drive.\n\nOne of the highlights of the Nexon EV 45 is its suspension setup. It does a commendable job of ironing out potholes and uneven surfaces, making city driving quite comfortable. That said, the weight of the large battery pack is noticeable, especially at higher speeds where you feel some body roll and lateral movement on long straights. This is where something like an MG Windsor EV Pro feels more confident and stable.\n\n(Also read: Living with the Tata Nexon EV for over 1,000 km. Here's what we learned)\n\nThe panoramic sunroof -- exclusive to the 45 kWh variant -- adds to the premium feel, and the inclusion of a small frunk under the hood is a practical touch for extra storage. There is also window sunshades available for the rear occupants. During our test, we did encounter a minor glitch with the instrument cluster, where the display information overlapped and became cluttered, something Tata will hopefully iron out in future updates.",

    "Explanation": "-India's equity benchmarks inched higher on Friday and logged weekly gains, led by banks after the regulator announced a raft of lending reforms and as metals advanced on dollar weakness.\n\nThe Nifty 50 rose 0.23% to 24,894.25, while the BSE Sensex added 0.28% to 81,207.17.\n\nThe indexes rose about 1% in the week, led by high-weight banks, state-owned lenders and private banks which rose 2.2%, 4.4% and 2.5%, respectively, after the Reserve Bank of India on Wednesday eased rules for lending to capital markets and large companies.\n\nThe RBI, which maintained rates as expected, also detailed plans to increase limits on lending against shares and reduce risk weights for non-bank lenders for infrastructure projects.\n\n\"The status quo on rates is a relief for banks as a rate cut would have led to contraction of net interest margins, while the relaxation of restrictions on bank loans will aid credit growth,\" said Prakhar Sharma and Vinayak Agrawal, equity analysts at Jefferies.\n\nMetals rose 1.8% on the day to a record high, lifting weekly gains to 3.9%, supported by a weaker dollar on firming October U.S. rate cut bets and supply disruptions. [MET/L]\n\nThe broader small-caps and mid-caps rose 1.8% and 2% this week.\n\nAmong individual stocks, Tata Motors rose 6.4%, marking its best week in nearly five months, after setting the effective date for the demerger of its truck and bus unit from the passenger vehicle business.\n\nSentiment was further lifted as Tata's luxury arm JLR announced a phased resumption of operations following a month-long shutdown.\n\nOn the day, V-Mart Retail and Sai Silks surged 16% and 18.4% after strong quarterly business updates.\n\nThe drivers for the next leg of the rally will be global liquidity and corporate earnings that kick off next week, said Sonam Srivastava, founder and fund manager at Wright Research PMS.",

    "Explanation": "The NSE Nifty 50 rose 58 points, or 0.2%, to close at 24,894, while the S&P BSE Sensex added 224 points, or 0.3%, to settle at 81,207, finishing near the day's highs. For the week, both indices advanced nearly 1% each.The stock market ended higher on Friday, capping the first week of October with solid gains as broad-based buying lifted benchmarks and sectoral indices alike.\n\nThe NSE Nifty 50 rose 58 points, or 0.2%, to close at 24,894, while the S&P BSE Sensex added 224 points, or 0.3%, to settle at 81,207, finishing near the day's highs. For the week, both indices advanced nearly 1% each.\n\nAccording to Vatsal Bhuva, Technical Analyst at LKP Securities, Nifty is expected to trade in a mildly bullish range of 24,750-25,100, with support at 24,750 and resistance at 25,000-25,100.\n\nBanking, metal and auto stocks provided the biggest boost, with the Nifty Bank climbing 241 points to 55,589 and the Nifty Midcap 100 surging 474 points to 57,503. All sectoral indices closed in the green, led by PSU banks and metals, each up 4% for the week. Defence stocks also advanced more than 2%, tracking supportive commentary ahead of Air Force Day.\n\nAmong gainers, Tata Motors, Shriram Finance and Kotak Mahindra Bank topped the Nifty pack, while Hindalco, Tata Steel and Nalco drove the metals rally. Hero MotoCorp rose over 2% on upbeat sales data, and UPL gained more than 2% after sources said it was set to sign a deal with PepsiCo.\n\nIn midcaps, MRPL, L&T Finance, Hindustan Zinc, Vodafone Idea and Aditya Birla Capital were the top performers, while PN Gadgil and PC Jeweller surged up to 5% on festive sales updates.\n\nCoal India was the biggest Nifty loser, falling nearly 2% after its September production update. Union Bank slipped close to 1%, even as Indian Bank rose over 3% on Q2 updates. Sammaan Capital snapped a six-day winning streak, falling more than 4% on deal news, while PB Fin Services pared early gains after reports of commission cuts for insurers.\n\nMarket breadth remained strong, with the NSE advance-decline ratio at 2:1, underscoring the outperformance of broader markets.",

    "Explanation": "Patil has had over 20 years of engineering experience. Prior to Anthropic, he was serving as CTO at Stripe and had been with the payments company for a little less than 6 years now. Before that, he was working as a senior VP for cloud infrastructure at Oracle and he held key roles at Amazon and Microsoft.\n\n2025 is shaping up to be the year of electric car sales. In a first, India's electric vehicles (EV) industry crossed the sales milestone of 100,000 units in FY25, fuelled by a slew of launches by major players, including Tata Motors, M&M, Ashok Leyland, JSW MG Motor, Hyundai, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz. The issue also looks at the challenges ahead for Tata Sons chairman N. Chandrasekaran in his third term, and India's possible responses to U.S. president Donald Trump's 50% tariff on Indian goods.

These measures lowered prices and unlocked consumer spending, leading to upgrades of vehicles, investments in home appliances, and increased spending on lifestyle goods.\n\nBrands and retailers across sectors reported significant sales growth, generally ranging from 25 per cent to 100 per cent. The festive season's first half, including Onam, Durga Puja, and Dussehra, is the country's largest consumption period, accounting for 40-45 per cent of total festive sales.\n\nAutomobile Sector Drives Growth\n\nThe automobile sector experienced a remarkable festive season: Maruti Suzuki's Navratri sales doubled from last year, marking its best performance in at least a decade. The car maker delivered a massive batch of 1.65 lakh vehicles in the first eight days of Navratri. On Day 1, Maruti delivered a record 30,000 cars, its best single-day performance in 35 years. The company reported 1,50,000 bookings and anticipates reaching 2,00,000 bookings, compared to 85,000 vehicles retailed last Navratri.\n\nMahindra & Mahindra recorded a 60 per cent year-on-year jump in retail sales for its popular SUVs, including the XUV700 and Scorpio N.\n\nTata Motors retailed over 50,000 vehicles, driven by demand for models such as the Altroz, Punch, Nexon and Tiago.\n\nAt Hyundai, demand for the Creta and Venue pushed SUVs' share of total sales to over 72 per cent.\n\nShowroom footfall for two-wheeler manufacturer Hero MotoCorp doubled this Navratri, with high traction in the commuter segment.\n\nBajaj Auto also reported strong sales during the period.\n\nBoom in Consumer Electronics\n\nThe consumer electronics sector saw significant high, double-digit sales growth compared to last year.\n\nHaier's sales soared by 85 per cent.\n\nThe company nearly sold out its Diwali stock of 85-inch and 100-inch TVs, priced above Rs 2.5 lakh, and sold 300-350 units of 65-inch TVs daily.\n\nSales at India's largest retailer, Reliance Retail, grew by 20-25 per cent over last year's Navratri, with sales momentum driven by large-screen TVs, smartphones and fashion.\n\nElectronics retail chain Vijay Sales saw sales growth of more than 20 per cent. LG Electronics India also noted \"exponential growth\" in sales this Navratri season.\n\nThe rationalisation of GST slabs and the easing of the tax burden on both essential and aspirational items fostered an environment of confident spending.\n\nShow full article\n\nTrack Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India and around the world\n\nGst Cut, GST Cut Car Prices, GST Cut In Auto Sector",

    "Title": "Best Off-Road Vehicles in India 2025: Conquer Any Terrain with Confidence",
    "Explanation": "India's diverse landscapes, from the towering Himalayas to the dense forests of the Western Ghats, offer a paradise for off-road enthusiasts. The thrill of navigating uncharted terrains, crossing rivers, and climbing rocky paths is unmatched. But to truly conquer these challenges, one needs a vehicle that's not just powerful but also reliable and equipped with advanced off-road capabilities.\n\nIn 2025, the Indian automotive market is brimming with vehicles designed to tackle the toughest terrains. Whether you're an adventure seeker, a professional needing to access remote areas, or someone who simply appreciates the robustness of off-road vehicles, there's something for everyone.\n\nThis comprehensive guide delves deep into the best off-road vehicles available in India in 2025. We'll explore their specifications, unique features, and what makes them stand out in the crowded SUV and pickup segments. So, buckle up as we embark on this exhilarating journey!\n\nThe Mahindra Thar has long been synonymous with off-roading in India. Its rugged design, powerful engine options, and advanced 4×4 capabilities make it a favorite among enthusiasts.\n\nIts blend of classic design with modern features ensures that the Thar remains a top choice for both urban driving and off-road adventures.\n\nThe Jeep Compass Trailhawk offers a refined driving experience without compromising on off-road prowess. It's equipped with Jeep's legendary 4×4 systems and advanced safety features.\n\nIt combines luxury and off-road capabilities, making it ideal for those who seek adventure without sacrificing comfort.\n\nTata Motors is set to revolutionize the off-road segment with the Harrier EV. Showcased conquering Kerala's Elephant Rock, this electric SUV promises power, range, and eco-friendliness.\n\nFor those looking to embrace sustainable mobility without compromising on adventure, the Harrier EV is the perfect choice.\n\nNicknamed the \"Desi G-Wagon,\" the Force Gurkha is built for serious off-roading. Its robust construction and utilitarian design make it a favorite among purists.\n\nIts no-nonsense approach to off-roading ensures reliability in the toughest conditions.\n\nThe Toyota Fortuner combines luxury with ruggedness. Its proven reliability and off-road capabilities make it a top choice for families and adventurers alike.\n\nIts blend of comfort, reliability, and off-road prowess makes it versatile for various needs.\n\nWith over 80 years of off-roading heritage, the Jeep Wrangler stands as an icon. Its Trail Rated badge signifies its capability to handle the toughest terrains.\n\nFor the purists who seek authentic off-roading experiences, the Wrangler is unmatched.\n\nThe Land Rover Defender redefines luxury off-roading. Its advanced technologies and plush interiors ensure that no terrain is off-limits.\n\nIt offers the perfect balance between opulence and off-road capability.\n\nIf you demand bulletproof reliability, legendary durability, and luxurious comfort while tackling extreme terrains -- from desert dunes to snow-packed mountains -- the Land Cruiser 300 is your go-to SUV.\n\nThe G-Class, especially in the AMG G63 avatar, is a status symbol and a beast off the road. With military origins and luxury DNA, this vehicle is designed to be as comfortable in a five-star hotel valet lot as it is on the treacherous Ladakh trails.\n\nIt's the only vehicle that can climb a mountain, cross a river, and still turn heads outside a five-star hotel. If you want performance and prestige in equal measure, the G-Wagon is your ultimate ride.\n\nThe Jimny brings old-school charm with modern reliability. It's compact, lightweight, and can go places where larger SUVs can't -- perfect for India's narrow trails and steep inclines.\n\nAffordable, nimble, and surprisingly capable -- perfect for new off-roaders or those looking for a fun second car that can handle mountain getaways.\n\nWhen buying an off-road vehicle in India, here are essential specs and systems to prioritize:\n\nQ1: Which is the best affordable off-road SUV in India?\n\nA: The Mahindra Thar and Maruti Suzuki Jimny are excellent budget-friendly options under ₹15 lakh.\n\nQ2: Are electric SUVs suitable for off-roading?\n\nA: Yes! The Tata Harrier EV demonstrates that with proper AWD setup and torque delivery, electric SUVs can perform exceptionally off-road.\n\nQ3: Is a diesel engine better for off-roading?\n\nA: Diesel engines usually offer better torque at lower RPMs, which is advantageous in off-road situations.\n\nQ4: Which off-roader is best for families?\n\nA: The Toyota Fortuner and Land Rover Defender balance space, comfort, and off-road capability well.\n\nQ5: What is the best luxury off-roader in India?\n\nA: The Mercedes-Benz G-Class and Land Cruiser 300 top the list for luxury and performance.\n\nOff-roading isn't just about big tyres and aggressive looks -- it's about capability, reliability, and confidence when the road ends. Whether you're a seasoned trail master or a weekend warrior looking to explore nature, 2025 offers a plethora of options in the Indian market.\n\nFrom the mighty Mahindra Thar to the electrified Tata Harrier EV, and the ultra-premium Land Cruiser 300, every off-roader has a story to tell. Identify your needs, budget, and preferred terrain -- then pick the beast that suits you.",

    "Title": "Could Rs 15,500-crore Tata Capital IPO be a game-changer? Here's what CEO Rajiv Sabharwal thinks",
    "Explanation": "Tata Capital IPO: Tata Capital is set to launch one of the largest initial public offerings (IPOs) in recent times. Backed by the Tata Group, the IPO is scheduled to open from October 6 to October 8, with a price band fixed at Rs 310-Rs 326 per share. Investors can bid in lots of 46 shares each.\n\nThe issue size is massive at Rs 15,500 crore, consisting of a fresh issue worth Rs 6,850 crore and an offer-for-sale (OFS) worth around Rs 8,650 crore.\n\nAt the upper end of the price band, Tata Capital's market capitalisation is estimated at nearly Rs 1.38 lakh crore, reflecting the sheer scale of the company.\n\nWhy the IPO Now?\n\nIn an exclusive interaction with Zee Business Managing Editor and market investor Anil Singhvi, Rajiv Sabharwal, MD & CEO of Tata Capital, explained the reasoning behind the IPO.\n\nHe highlighted that the move comes after the Reserve Bank of India placed Tata Capital in the \"upper layer\" of NBFCs, which requires mandatory listing within a specific timeframe.\n\n\"This IPO is not about the promoter needing funds,\" Sabharwal clarified. \"It is about meeting regulatory requirements and positioning Tata Capital for its next phase of growth.\"\n\nWho is Selling in the OFS?\n\nAccording to Sabharwal, the OFS will primarily involve Tata Sons (Tata SS), which will dilute about 6% of its stake.\n\nIn addition, equity partner IFC Washington will also partially dilute its 1.7% holding, selling around half of it.\n\nNo other Tata Group listed companies are selling shares in this offering.\n\nDiversified Business Model\n\nTata Capital is India's third-largest diversified NBFC, with a strong presence across retail, SME, and corporate finance.\n\nIts portfolio includes over 25 products, with nearly 89% of its loan book focused on retail and SME lending. Housing finance alone accounts for about half of the retail segment.\n\nThe company recently merged with Tata Motors Finance, giving it an entry into commercial vehicle financing, a segment where it previously had limited presence.\n\nWhile the merger has temporarily created some asset quality pressures due to Tata Motors Finance's higher gross NPAs, Sabharwal remains confident:\n\n\"We are already working on improving processes. Over the next 18 to 24 months, we expect financials to improve. Tata Capital's book remains granular, and our credit cost is one of the lowest in the industry.\"\n\nStrong Growth and Future Outlook\n\nIn FY23, Tata Capital recorded impressive loan growth of around 34%, though this has now normalised to about 17%. However, excluding the merger impact, the company's core book still grew 23% in Q1.\n\nSabharwal is optimistic about the coming quarters, particularly after the recent GST rate cuts.\n\n\"We are already seeing positive signs in vehicle sales, consumer products, and housing. Q3, with the festive season, should be very strong, followed by a traditionally strong Q4,\" he said.\n\nHe also emphasised that the company is focusing on affordable housing, consumer loans, leasing, and unsecured lending, where margins are higher.\n\n\"In affordable housing, we are already among the top two or three players in the country,\" he added.\n\nIPO Pricing and Investor Focus\n\nOn pricing concerns, Sabharwal stressed that Tata Capital chose an investor-friendly approach. The IPO price band is about 5% lower than the company's last rights issue price.\n\n\"The idea is to bring in as many retail investors as possible at attractive levels. That has always been the Tata philosophy, to remain investor-friendly,\" he explained.\n\nCompeting with Other Mega IPOs\n\nWhen asked about competing mega IPOs opening around the same time, Sabharwal remained confident.\n\n\"Our focus is on delivering strong performance. Share prices are not in our hands, but business performance is. We want investors to feel happy and rewarded,\" he said, adding that the company wishes success to all upcoming IPOs.",

    "Title": "Tata Motors Share Price Trades at Rs. 718.90, Demerger in Focus",
    "Explanation": "Adani Power Shares Surge 2.20% to Rs. 147.83, Key Support and Resistance Levels Explained\n\nThe separation of CV and PV divisions is expected to create better operational efficiency and market-driven strategies. The CV segment, which will carry forward non-convertible debentures worth ₹2,300 crore, is projected to benefit from infrastructure growth and rising demand for fleet modernization. The PV business, meanwhile, is likely to focus on premiumisation, electrification, and leveraging JLR synergies.\n\nDespite short-term volatility, most analysts remain cautiously optimistic. Out of 28 analysts on Moneycontrol, 25% recommend a 'Buy' and 18% see an 'Outperform,' while 32% suggest 'Hold.' Only 14% advise 'Sell,' reflecting balanced but positive sentiment.\n\nTata Motors is entering a new phase in its journey with the demerger complete and separate listings on the horizon. For investors, the split offers an opportunity to tap into two distinct growth stories. On one hand, there is the steady potential of passenger vehicles. On the other hand, they can invest in the cyclical but high-margin opportunity in commercial vehicles.",

      "body": "Adani Power Shares Surge 2.20% to Rs. 147.83, Key Support and Resistance Levels Explained\n\nThe separation of CV and PV divisions is expected to create better operational efficiency and market-driven strategies. The CV segment, which will carry forward non-convertible debentures worth ₹2,300 crore, is projected to benefit from infrastructure growth and rising demand for fleet modernization. The PV business, meanwhile, is likely to focus on premiumisation, electrification, and leveraging JLR synergies.\n\nDespite short-term volatility, most analysts remain cautiously optimistic. Out of 28 analysts on Moneycontrol, 25% recommend a 'Buy' and 18% see an 'Outperform,' while 32% suggest 'Hold.' Only 14% advise 'Sell,' reflecting balanced but positive sentiment.\n\nTata Motors is entering a new phase in its journey with the demerger complete and separate listings on the horizon. For investors, the split offers an opportunity to tap into two distinct growth stories. On one hand, there is the steady potential of passenger vehicles. On the other hand, they can invest in the cyclical but high-margin opportunity in commercial vehicles.",

The policy announcement boosted sentiment, particularly in metal and banking stocks, helping markets recover from a weaker opening.\n\nMetal stocks dominated the gainers list, with Tata Steel rising 4.09 per cent to ₹174.36 and Hindalco advancing 2.70 per cent to ₹786.60. JSW Steel gained 1.52 per cent to ₹1,163.50. Power Grid Corporation climbed 2.10 per cent to ₹286.55, while Kotak Mahindra Bank added 1.38 per cent to ₹2,091.70, supported by expectations of stronger credit growth following the RBI's positive economic outlook.\n\nMax Healthcare led the decliners, falling 3.85 per cent to ₹1,070.30.

A total of 165 stocks hit 52-week highs compared to 70 touching 52-week lows. Some 211 stocks were locked in upper circuit against 161 in lower circuit.\n\nSectoral indices showed mixed movement, with Nifty Bank gaining 0.37 per cent to 55,554.40 and Nifty Next 50 up 0.20 per cent at 68,224.25. Nifty Financial Services edged down 0.04 per cent to 26,370.70.\n\nForeign institutional investors sold equities worth ₹1,605 crore on October 1, while domestic institutional investors bought ₹2,916 crore, providing support to the market.

    "Title": "Tata Motors share price target: Buy, Sell or Hold? What expert said",
    "Explanation": "New Delhi: The shares of Tata Motors are expected to rise, Anshul Jain, Director General of Laxmishree Securities, said. Initiating a Buy rating on Tata Motors stock, the market expert stated that previously, his brokerage house had set a small target of Rs 735, which has been achieved.\n\nHe advised the shareholders to book profits as it was recommended to buy the shares of the automobile major at around Rs 665 apiece. Jain further said that after the stock crosses Rs 735, Laxmishree Securities will initiate a long position, with a target of Rs 810. He advised the investors to enter the counter at Rs 736 apiece.\n\nThe Tata Motors shares had touched a high of Rs 984 on October 1, 2024, but failed to maintain its momentum. On September 30, 2025, it closed at Rs 680, a decline of over 30 per cent. However, the counter has recorded a decent rally in the past five days and was trading at Rs 716.35 on October 3, 2025.\n\nTata Motors demerger\n\nEffective October 1, Tata Motors split the automotive major's commercial vehicle (CV) and passenger vehicle (PV) businesses into two independent listed companies.

      "body": "New Delhi: The shares of Tata Motors are expected to rise, Anshul Jain, Director General of Laxmishree Securities, said. Initiating a Buy rating on Tata Motors stock, the market expert stated that previously, his brokerage house had set a small target of Rs 735, which has been achieved.\n\nHe advised the shareholders to book profits as it was recommended to buy the shares of the automobile major at around Rs 665 apiece. Jain further said that after the stock crosses Rs 735, Laxmishree Securities will initiate a long position, with a target of Rs 810. He advised the investors to enter the counter at Rs 736 apiece.\n\nThe Tata Motors shares had touched a high of Rs 984 on October 1, 2024, but failed to maintain its momentum. On September 30, 2025, it closed at Rs 680, a decline of over 30 per cent. However, the counter has recorded a decent rally in the past five days and was trading at Rs 716.35 on October 3, 2025.\n\nTata Motors demerger\n\nEffective October 1, Tata Motors split the automotive major's commercial vehicle (CV) and passenger vehicle (PV) businesses into two independent listed companies.

    "Title": "Updated Mahindra Thar Launched At Rs 9.99 lakh; Borrows Cabin And Features From Roxx",
    "Explanation": "Two new paint choices - Tango Red and Battleship GreyPowertrain remains unchangedNew feature additions with cabin borrowed from the Roxx\n\nMahindra has finally updated the Thar with newer features, five years after the current gen was launched in India. This is not a facelift, but the updated Thar 3-Door is priced at Rs 9.99 lakhs and is available across two new variant designations - LX and AX - apart from two new paint choices - Tango Red and Battleship Grey.\n\nAlso read: Tata Motors Snatches Second Place In Passenger Vehicle Retails In September 2025\n\nChanges to the exterior include body coloured grille and a dual-tone front bumper akin to the one seen on the Roxx. At the back, the spare wheel gets a rear-view camera while the windscreen now gets a wiper and washer. Lastly, the fuel-filler cap now loses the key operation and gets an internal switch, which is a welcome addition.\n\nOn the inside, the Roxx-inspired cabin gets more creature comforts, like a grab handle for easy ingress, an armrest with storage, cupholders in the centre console and the window switches move to their original position - on the door pads. There are also soft-touch materials on the door pads. Coming back to the centre console, you get a 65W USB Type-C port and a wireless charging pad, while the air vents remain untouched.\n\nAnd the biggest change comes in the form of the newer 10.25-inch touchscreen, which replaces the older monochromatic screen, and this new one also comes with wireless smartphone integration. However, the driver's display remains analogue. Lastly, courtesy of the armrest, the rear passengers also get rear AC vents and a Type-C USB port.\n\nAlso Read: 2024 Mahindra Thar Roxx 4x4 Review: More Space, More Utility, More Features\n\nUnder the skin, there are no changes as all three powertrains are carried over. You get the 1.5-litre diesel and the 2.2-litre mHawk apart from the 2.0-litre petrol. Both gearbox choices are carried over. There are no changes to off-road hardware either.",

    "Title": "Festive stocking, tax relief and GST cuts to drive auto demand in H2FY26; September sales show mixed trend",
    "Explanation": "New Delhi, Oct 3 (SocialNews.XYZ) The Indian automobile industry is heading into the second half of FY26 with cautious optimism, as festive stocking, reduction in GST rates, and income tax relief are expected to boost consumer demand, a report said on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, September sales data reflected a mixed trend -- with strong growth in two-wheelers, three-wheelers, commercial vehicles, and tractors, even as passenger vehicle volumes slipped on a Year-on-Year (YoY) basis, Axis Securities highlighted.\n\nTwo Wheeler/Three Wheeler (2W/3W) Segment: Domestic two-wheeler sales rose 6 per cent YoY and 18 per cent month-on-month (MoM), supported by strong performances from Royal Enfield (43 per cent YoY), Suzuki Motorcycle (37 per cent YoY), and TVS Motor (12 per cent YoY).\n\nExports remained firm, rising 17 per cent YoY and 2 per cent MoM, led by Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp, RE, and TVS.\n\nThree-wheeler sales recorded 12 per cent YoY and 6 per cent MoM growth, largely driven by M&M (30 per cent YoY) and TVS (60 per cent YoY), the report noted.\n\nPassenger Vehicles (PV): The PV segment saw a 5 per cent YoY decline in wholesales, though sales rebounded 16 per cent MoM, aided by deferred inventory clearance and GST reductions.\n\nJSW MG Motor and Tata Motors outperformed with 47 per cent and 45 per cent YoY growth, respectively, followed by Toyota Kirloskar (31 per cent YoY) and M&M (10 per cent YoY). Maruti Suzuki, however, slipped 6 per cent YoY, while Hyundai remained flat.\n\nCompany-wise, Tata Motors' PV sales jumped 45 per cent YoY, while M&M's PV division rose 10 per cent YoY. Maruti Suzuki reported a 6 per cent YoY drop in domestic sales, though MoM performance improved 2 per cent.\n\nTractors: The tractor industry witnessed a sharp rebound, with volumes up 50 per cent YoY and 124 per cent MoM, buoyed by good monsoons and high reservoir levels. M&M's tractor sales surged 50 per cent YoY and 148 per cent MoM, Escorts Kubota rose 49 per cent YoY and 125 per cent MoM, while VST Tillers and Tractors posted a 42 per cent YoY gain but fell 27 per cent sequentially.\n\nCommercial Vehicles (CV): Domestic CV sales rose 11 per cent YoY and 19 per cent MoM. Tata Motors and M&M recorded mid-double-digit growth, while Ashok Leyland reported a 9 per cent YoY rise. Eicher Motors' VECV division remained flat YoY, but improved 6 per cent MoM. Maruti Suzuki's CV sales fell 7 per cent YoY.\n\nAxis security said that it remains cautiously optimistic for H2FY26, expecting high single-digit growth in PVs and steady demand in CVs, supported by festive demand, GST cuts, rural recovery, and new model launches.\n\nTractor sales are also expected to remain buoyant, aided by improved kharif harvest and reservoir conditions, the domestic brokerage firm said.",

Tata Steel, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Tata Motors and Asian Paints were among major gainers on the Nifty pack, while losers included Max Healthcare, Bajaj Finance, Shriram Finance and ICICI Bank, among others.\n\nThe Indian benchmark indices opened with mild losses on Friday due to sustained FII selling, despite positive global cues and market optimism driven by the Reserve Bank of India's dovish pause.\n\nAs of 9.20 am, the Sensex was down 191 points, or 0.24 per cent at 80,792 and the Nifty declined 56 points, or 0.23 per cent at 24,780.\n\nThe broad cap indices, Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Smallcap 100, inched up 0.22 and 0.14 per cent respectively. Tata Steel, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Tata Motors and Asian Paints were among major gainers on the Nifty pack, while losers included Max Healthcare, Bajaj Finance, Shriram Finance and ICICI Bank, among others.\n\nAmong sectoral indices, Nifty Metal, the top gainer, advanced 0.89 per cent. Nifty PSU Bank (up 0.59 per cent) and Nifty Pharma (up 0.30 per cent) were other major gainers. Nifty Media and Nifty FMCG were the top losers down 0.65 per cent and 0.45 per cent respectively.\n\nAnalysts said that from a technical perspective, a sustained move above 24,900 could pave the way for a rally toward 25,000 and 25,150. The immediate support is placed at 24,750 and 24,600, which may act as potential entry points for long trades.\n\nThe US markets ended in the green zone overnight, as Nasdaq edged up 0.39 per cent, the S&P 500 added 0.06 per cent, and the Dow moved up 0.17 per cent in the last trading session.\n\nAsia-Pacific markets mostly rose Friday, tracking Wall Street gains as investors shrugged off the US government shutdown. Investors are waiting to see how long the shutdown will last to assess the gravity of its economic repercussions.\n\nWhile China's Shanghai index added 0.52 per cent, and Shenzhen advanced 0.35 per cent, Japan's Nikkei added 1.44 per cent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index declined 0.84 per cent. South Korea's Kospi added 2.70 per cent.\n\nAnalysts said that the central bank's bold initiatives to boost credit growth in the economy can positively sustain the momentum in the market, particularly in Bank Nifty. However, the sustained selling by FIIs in the market is unlikely to sustain this momentum.\n\nFIIs are likely to further accelerate selling since the market construct provides them the opportunity to sell aggressively. Robust buying from DIIs can provide some support to the market, particularly in large-cap auto stocks, which have strong fundamental support now, they added.\n\nIn the last trading session on Wednesday, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold equities worth Rs 1,605 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) were net buyers of equities worth Rs 2,916 crore.",

    "Title": "Business News | Jehangir Hospital: Pune's Most Advanced Robotic Orthopaedic Surgery Clinic | LatestLY",
    "Explanation": "Pune (Maharashtra) [India], October 3: For over 80 years, Jehangir Hospital has been Pune's trusted name in healthcare, known for excellence and compassionate care. Continuing this legacy, the hospital introduces the city's most advanced joint replacement solution -- the Advanced Robotic Orthopaedic Surgery Clinic, powered by the globally acclaimed MAKO Robotic-Arm Assisted System. This breakthrough combines robotic precision with the expertise of certified orthopaedic surgeons, delivering safer, more accurate, and personalised surgeries that restore mobility and enhance quality of life -- faster than ever.\n\nAlso Read | Tata Motors Demerger: Automaker Announces Record Date for Demerger of Its Commercial Vehicles Business on October 14.\n\nThe Scope - More Than Just Joint Replacement:\n\nMore than just conventional procedures, this clinic is a comprehensive hub for complex, life-changing orthopaedic care, powered by the MAKO Robotic-Arm Assisted System and expert surgeons.\n\nAlso Read | Bihar CM Nitish Kumar Transfers INR 10,000 Each to 25 Lakh Women Under Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana (See Pics).\n\nOur expertise covers the full spectrum of advanced joint care. From Total Knee Replacements (TKR) that ensure perfect alignment and longer implant life in advanced arthritis, to Partial Knee Replacements that preserve healthy bone and tissue when only part of the knee is affected. We also offer Total Hip Replacements (THR) with micrometre precision for pain-free mobility, along with complex hip reconstructions and replacements designed for deformities, failed surgeries, or severe joint damage. In addition, our advanced robotic procedures include revision surgeries, deformity corrections, joint preservation techniques, and treatment of failed or infected implants -- all performed with unmatched precision and safety.\n\nSurgery is just the first step. Our dedicated physiotherapy team delivers customised programmes to restore strength, flexibility, and independence. From gait training to joint functionality, every detail is designed to speed recovery, optimise fitness, and extend implant longevity.\n\nHow Robotic Surgery Works - Precision You Can Trust:\n\nThe process begins with a high-resolution CT scan, creating a 3D model of the joint and enabling surgeons to plan every detail in advance. During surgery, the MAKO system's AccuStop™ haptic guidance acts as a safeguard, keeping instruments within pre-set safe zones. This protects healthy bone and tissue while allowing implant placement with millimetre-level precision -- accuracy beyond the reach of the human hand alone.\n\nWhile the MAKO system delivers unmatched precision, it is guided by the expertise and empathy of Jehangir Hospital's Certified Robotic Surgeons -- Dr. Rahul Damle, Dr. Aashish Arbat, Dr. Suresh Patil, Dr. Yogesh Jain, Dr. Anshu Sachdev, and Dr. Kunal Bansal. Trained in advanced orthopaedic techniques and internationally certified in robotic-assisted surgery, they blend deep anatomical knowledge, surgical skill, and compassionate care with cutting-edge robotics -- ensuring every procedure is not only clinically precise, but also truly personalised.\n\nSurgeons' Perspectives:\n\nDr. Rahul Damle, Senior Consultant Orthopaedic and Certified Robotic Joint Replacement Surgeon, explains: \"This programme is a milestone in our mission to bring world-class orthopaedic solutions to Pune. It gives us unprecedented precision and control, enabling us to deliver joint replacements that are not only accurate but also tailored for each patient. This means better joint function, quicker recovery, and an improved quality of life.\"\n\nDr. Aashish Arbat, Senior Consultant Orthopaedic and Certified Robotic Joint Replacement Surgeon says: \"The MAKO robotic system at Jehangir Hospital allows me to offer my patients a level of precision and personalization that was not possible with conventional techniques. As a trained and MAKO-certified surgeon, I have seen how this technology enhances surgical accuracy, ensures optimal implant placement, and speeds up recovery. My focus is always on delivering personalised surgical experience with exceptional outcomes, and with MAKO, I can confidently provide patients with safer, more reliable, and long-lasting joint replacements.\"\n\nDr. Suresh Patil, Senior Consultant Orthopaedic and American Board (ABPS) Certified Robotic Joint Replacement Surgeon explains: \"This advancement supports safer procedures, more natural movement, less implant wear, and longer-lasting results for patients. It is now used across joint replacement procedures -- including robotic joint replacements, hip replacement through the direct anterior (muscle-sparing) approach, minimally invasive knee and hip replacements, and revision surgeries for previously unsuccessful procedures. I see this as an important milestone in orthopaedic technology -- helping people regain comfort, mobility, and confidence.\"\n\nDr. Yogesh Jain, Senior Consultant Orthopaedic and Certified Robotic Joint Replacement Surgeon says: \"With robotic assistance, we can customise every aspect of the surgery to the patient's needs.

    "Title": "Festive stocking, tax relief and GST cuts to drive auto demand in H2FY26; September sales show mixed trend",
    "Explanation": "The Indian automobile industry is heading into the second half of FY26 with cautious optimism, as festive stocking, reduction in GST rates, and income...\n\nThe Indian automobile industry is heading into the second half of FY26 with cautious optimism, as festive stocking, reduction in GST rates, and income tax relief are expected to boost consumer demand, a report said on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, September sales data reflected a mixed trend -- with strong growth in two-wheelers, three-wheelers, commercial vehicles, and tractors, even as passenger vehicle volumes slipped on a Year-on-Year (YoY) basis, Axis Securities highlighted.\n\nTwo Wheeler/Three Wheeler (2W/3W) Segment: Domestic two-wheeler sales rose 6 per cent YoY and 18 per cent month-on-month (MoM), supported by strong performances from Royal Enfield (43 per cent YoY), Suzuki Motorcycle (37 per cent YoY), and TVS Motor (12 per cent YoY).\n\nExports remained firm, rising 17 per cent YoY and 2 per cent MoM, led by Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp, RE, and TVS.\n\nThree-wheeler sales recorded 12 per cent YoY and 6 per cent MoM growth, largely driven by M&M (30 per cent YoY) and TVS (60 per cent YoY), the report noted.\n\nPassenger Vehicles (PV): The PV segment saw a 5 per cent YoY decline in wholesales, though sales rebounded 16 per cent MoM, aided by deferred inventory clearance and GST reductions.\n\nJSW MG Motor and Tata Motors outperformed with 47 per cent and 45 per cent YoY growth, respectively, followed by Toyota Kirloskar (31 per cent YoY) and M&M (10 per cent YoY). Maruti Suzuki, however, slipped 6 per cent YoY, while Hyundai remained flat.\n\nCompany-wise, Tata Motors' PV sales jumped 45 per cent YoY, while M&M's PV division rose 10 per cent YoY. Maruti Suzuki reported a 6 per cent YoY drop in domestic sales, though MoM performance improved 2 per cent.\n\nTractors: The tractor industry witnessed a sharp rebound, with volumes up 50 per cent YoY and 124 per cent MoM, buoyed by good monsoons and high reservoir levels. M&M's tractor sales surged 50 per cent YoY and 148 per cent MoM, Escorts Kubota rose 49 per cent YoY and 125 per cent MoM, while VST Tillers and Tractors posted a 42 per cent YoY gain but fell 27 per cent sequentially.\n\nCommercial Vehicles (CV): Domestic CV sales rose 11 per cent YoY and 19 per cent MoM. Tata Motors and M&M recorded mid-double-digit growth, while Ashok Leyland reported a 9 per cent YoY rise. Eicher Motors' VECV division remained flat YoY, but improved 6 per cent MoM. Maruti Suzuki's CV sales fell 7 per cent YoY.\n\nAxis security said that it remains cautiously optimistic for H2FY26, expecting high single-digit growth in PVs and steady demand in CVs, supported by festive demand, GST cuts, rural recovery, and new model launches.\n\nTractor sales are also expected to remain buoyant, aided by improved kharif harvest and reservoir conditions, the domestic brokerage firm said.",

    "Explanation": "New Delhi: The Indian automobile industry is heading into the second half of FY26 with cautious optimism, as festive stocking, reduction in GST rates, and income tax relief are expected to boost consumer demand, a report said on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, September sales data reflected a mixed trend -- with strong growth in two-wheelers, three-wheelers, commercial vehicles, and tractors, even as passenger vehicle volumes slipped on a Year-on-Year (YoY) basis, Axis Securities highlighted.\n\nTwo Wheeler/Three Wheeler (2W/3W) Segment: Domestic two-wheeler sales rose 6 per cent YoY and 18 per cent month-on-month (MoM), supported by strong performances from Royal Enfield (43 per cent YoY), Suzuki Motorcycle (37 per cent YoY), and TVS Motor (12 per cent YoY).\n\nExports remained firm, rising 17 per cent YoY and 2 per cent MoM, led by Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp, RE, and TVS.\n\nThree-wheeler sales recorded 12 per cent YoY and 6 per cent MoM growth, largely driven by M&M (30 per cent YoY) and TVS (60 per cent YoY), the report noted.\n\nPassenger Vehicles (PV): The PV segment saw a 5 per cent YoY decline in wholesales, though sales rebounded 16 per cent MoM, aided by deferred inventory clearance and GST reductions.\n\nJSW MG Motor and Tata Motors outperformed with 47 per cent and 45 per cent YoY growth, respectively, followed by Toyota Kirloskar (31 per cent YoY) and M&M (10 per cent YoY). Maruti Suzuki, however, slipped 6 per cent YoY, while Hyundai remained flat.\n\nCompany-wise, Tata Motors' PV sales jumped 45 per cent YoY, while M&M's PV division rose 10 per cent YoY. Maruti Suzuki reported a 6 per cent YoY drop in domestic sales, though MoM performance improved 2 per cent.\n\nTractors: The tractor industry witnessed a sharp rebound, with volumes up 50 per cent YoY and 124 per cent MoM, buoyed by good monsoons and high reservoir levels. M&M's tractor sales surged 50 per cent YoY and 148 per cent MoM, Escorts Kubota rose 49 per cent YoY and 125 per cent MoM, while VST Tillers and Tractors posted a 42 per cent YoY gain but fell 27 per cent sequentially.\n\nCommercial Vehicles (CV): Domestic CV sales rose 11 per cent YoY and 19 per cent MoM. Tata Motors and M&M recorded mid-double-digit growth, while Ashok Leyland reported a 9 per cent YoY rise. Eicher Motors' VECV division remained flat YoY, but improved 6 per cent MoM. Maruti Suzuki's CV sales fell 7 per cent YoY.\n\nAxis security said that it remains cautiously optimistic for H2FY26, expecting high single-digit growth in PVs and steady demand in CVs, supported by festive demand, GST cuts, rural recovery, and new model launches.\n\nTractor sales are also expected to remain buoyant, aided by improved kharif harvest and reservoir conditions, the domestic brokerage firm said.",

    "Title": "Tata Motors Demerger: Automaker Announces Record Date for Demerger of Its Commercial Vehicles Business on October 14 | 🚘 LatestLY",
    "Explanation": "New Delhi, October 3: Tata Motors demerger came into effect on October 1, 2025, marking the start of a new phase for the automaker. The company has now been separated into two distinct, publicly listed companies. The Tata Motors division is divided into two entities, one dedicated to commercial vehicles (CV) and one dedicated to passenger vehicles (PV). The restructuring was approved earlier by the board, regulators, and the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in compliance with legal and governance standards. Tata Motors has also announced the record date for demerger.\n\nThe demerger is intended to enable each division to function independently to focus on its unique market needs, growth opportunities, and capital requirements. Tata Motors seeks to strengthen operational efficiency and provide its shareholders with greater value through focused and efficient business management. Rahul Gandhi Hails Indian Two-Wheeler Manufacturers, Says 'Proud To See Bajaj, Hero & TVS Do So Well in Colombia'.\n\nAs per reports, Tata Motors commercial vehicle business covering buses, trucks, and other heavy-duty models is overseen by Girish Wagh. The passenger vehicle arm, which includes cars, SUVs, electric models, and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is under the leadership of Shailesh Chandra. As per reports, the share entitlement ratio will be 1:1, so that Tata Motors shareholders will hold the same proportion in both companies.\n\nAs per a report of The Economic Times, Tata Motors has set October 14, 2025, as the record date for the planned demerger of its commercial vehicle division. On this day, each Tata Motors shareholder will be allotted one fully paid share of TMLCV for every share they own in Tata Motors, with each share carrying a face value of INR 2. These shares are proposed to be listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE), once all regulatory approvals are completed.

Rahul Gandhi Hails Indian Two-Wheeler Manufacturers, Says 'Proud To See Bajaj, Hero & TVS Do So Well in Colombia'.\n\nAs per reports, Tata Motors commercial vehicle business covering buses, trucks, and other heavy-duty models is overseen by Girish Wagh. The passenger vehicle arm, which includes cars, SUVs, electric models, and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is under the leadership of Shailesh Chandra. As per reports, the share entitlement ratio will be 1:1, so that Tata Motors shareholders will hold the same proportion in both companies.\n\nAs per a report of The Economic Times, Tata Motors has set October 14, 2025, as the record date for the planned demerger of its commercial vehicle division. On this day, each Tata Motors shareholder will be allotted one fully paid share of TMLCV for every share they own in Tata Motors, with each share carrying a face value of INR 2. These shares are proposed to be listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE), once all regulatory approvals are completed.

    "Explanation": "Tata Motors became the second-best-selling carmaker in the Indian market in September 2025. Racing past Mahindra and Hyundai, the automaker has registered strong sales in the SUV and electric vehicle segment. Furthermore, the Indian manufacturer also widened its gap with JSW MG Motor India in the EV segment.\n\nAccording to data from the Vahan portal provided by the government, Tata has moved up from fourth place last year to second, now trailing only market leader Maruti Suzuki. The performance in September signifies a return to the second spot after briefly holding it in March of this year.\n\nAlso Read: Maruti Suzuki Victoris Gets 25,000 Bookings; Deliveries Begin\n\nIn September, Tata recorded 40,594 vehicle sales, reflecting a 28 percent increase compared to 31,581 units sold in the same month last year. Hyundai has dropped to fourth place with 35,443 registrations, declining from 37,666, while Mahindra increased its sales to 37,015 units but remained in third place. Maruti Suzuki continued to lead the market with 122,278 vehicles registered, up from 113,560.\n\nHyundai's slip to fourth is an indication of lower demand for its Creta and Venue models, while its premium electric vehicles, such as the Ioniq 5 and Creta EV, continue to cater to a niche market. Mahindra maintained its third-place ranking with popular models, including the Scorpio-N, Bolero, XUV700, and Thar, although its mass-market electric vehicles are not expected until 2026.\n\nThe Tata Nexon SUV drove record sales, achieving its highest monthly sales ever for any Tata model with over 22,500 units sold. The mid-size SUV models, the Harrier and Safari, also sustained strong performance, reaching their highest combined sales figures to date.\n\nIn the realm of green mobility, electric vehicle sales nearly doubled, experiencing a 96 percent year-over-year increase to 9,191 units. Likewise, CNG vehicle sales reached a record high of over 17,800 units, showcasing a growth of more than 105 percent compared to Q2 FY25.\n\nShow full article\n\nTrack Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India and around the world\n\nTata Motors, Hyundai, Mahindra, Tata Motors Sales",

    "Title": "Citroen Aircross X Launched In India At Rs 8.29 Lakh; Gets More Features",
    "Explanation": "Citroen India has launched the Aircross X in the Indian market at a starting price of Rs 8.29 lakh (ex-showroom). This is the third model that the French automaker has launched under its Citroen 2.0 \"Shift Into the New\" strategy, following the C3X and the Basalt X in the Indian market. With the 'X' suffix, the SUV gets some major interior changes along with additions in the feature list aimed at improving its appeal for consumers.\n\nWhile the outside changes are limited to the addition of a new Deep Forest Green colour and 'X' in the Aircross lettering present on the tailgate, the brand has made multiple changes on the inside. The SUV now gets soft-touch leatherette wrapping on the instrument panel and door bolsters. On the tech side of tech, the brand has added a bezel-less 10.25-inch infotainment display and a 7-inch digital instrument cluster. To go with all of this, there are gold accents on certain elements.\n\nAlso Read: Tata Motors Trumps Hyundai, Mahindra In Sept'25 Sales, Secures Second Spot\n\nThe upgrades in the cabin can be further seen in the form of a redesigned gear lever, ventilated leatherette seats, and diffused ambient lighting & Footwell Lighting. All of this is complemented by a deep brown interior theme aimed at offering a premium feel.\n\nIn terms of features, the Citroen Aircross X has gained a passive entry & push start button, cruise control, speed limiter, Auto IRVM, LED Projector Fog Lamps, ventilated seats, and a 360-degree camera with satellite view. The brand has also added CARA AI to the SUV, which was introduced with the Basalt X.\n\nWith a five-star BNCAP safety rating, the SUV gets multiple features like high-strength body structure for better crash protection, six airbags, ESP, Hill hold, ABS with EBD, rear parking sensors, and overall consisting of more than 40 Active & passive safety features.\n\nCitroen Aircross X Variant-Wise Prices\n\nVariants/PowertrainPURETECH 82 MT\n\n1.2P NAPURETECH 110 MT\n\n1.2P TURBOPURETECH 110 AT\n\n1.2P TURBONumber of Seats577YOU829,000--PLUS977,0001,137,000-MAX*-1,234,5001,349,100\n\nThe powertrain of the Citroen Aircross X is identical to that of the standard variant of the SUV, featuring an 82hp 1.2-litre 3-cylinder naturally aspirated petrol engine paired exclusively with a 5-speed manual transmission.

      "body": "Tata Motors has slashed the pricing of the Nexon SUV by up to ₹1.55 lakh.\n\nTata Nexon is certainly the most popular sub-compact SUV in India. The SUV that helped Tata grab a sizeable share in the Indian passenger vehicle market's utility vehicle segment has received a significant amount of price cut following the GST rate reduction right ahead of the festive season, which is expected to boost its appeal further to the consumers. The price cut ranges up to ₹1.55 lakh, which is likely to boost the sales numbers of the Nexon in the coming weeks.",

    "Title": "Best Navratri In Decade For Car Sales: Maruti, SUV Sales Fuel India's Strongest Festive Surge In 10 Years",
    "Explanation": "India's carmakers have led the charge in what turned out to be the strongest Navratri sales season in over a decade, setting the stage for a blockbuster Diwali, The Economic Times reported.\n\nMaruti Suzuki, the country's top car manufacturer, recorded its best-ever Navratri sales in at least 10 years, with sales doubling compared to last year. As of Wednesday, there were 700,530 enquiries for the cars and 150,000 bookings, with expectations to touch 200,000 bookings by Thursday evening. Last year, the company sold 85,000 vehicles during Navratri.\n\nMahindra & Mahindra also rode the festive wave, reporting a 60% jump in retails, driven by its popular SUVs XUV700 and Scorpio N. Hyundai witnessed strong demand for the Creta and Venue, with SUVs contributing more than 72% of its total sales. Hero MotoCorp, meanwhile, reported double showroom footfalls with commuter bikes seeing robust traction.\n\nTata Motors joined the festive success story by retailing over 50,000 vehicles during the period, with Altroz, Punch, Nexon, and Tiago leading the charge.\n\nBeyond automobiles, the festive cheer spread across consumer electronics and retail. LG, Haier, and Godrej Appliances posted high double-digit growth, with Haier's sales soaring 85% and premium TV models nearly sold out. \"The Navratri sales this year were driven by the direct benefit of the GST rate cut and the indirect boost it gave to customer sentiment,\" said Satish NS, president of Haier India, told the English publication.\n\nLG's Sanjay Chitkara echoed the optimism, describing the growth as \"exponential.\"\n\nRetail too saw strong gains, with Reliance Retail reporting a 20-25% jump in sales compared to last year. Footfalls at malls picked up steadily after Amazon and Flipkart's mega online sales, bringing fresh momentum to offline stores.\n\nThe Economic Times report highlights that this year's Navratri demand surged between 25% and 100% across categories, marking a sharp turnaround after five to six years of sluggish consumption. With the first half of the festive season already proving buoyant, companies are now gearing up for Diwali, Dhanteras, and the wedding season - all expected to add further sparkle to India's consumption story.",

    "Explanation": "Adalat AI, incubated at MIT and Oxford, based on research conducted at Harvard, specialise in AI and LLM-driven solutions that address the pressing issues of case backlogs, prolonged delays in legal systems, and the ensuing social injustices caused by these delays. In collaboration with courts, the startup is pioneering voice transcription software specifically designed to assist court judges and stenographers.\n\n2025 is shaping up to be the year of electric car sales. In a first, India's electric vehicles (EV) industry crossed the sales milestone of 100,000 units in FY25, fuelled by a slew of launches by major players, including Tata Motors, M&M, Ashok Leyland, JSW MG Motor, Hyundai, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz. The issue also looks at the challenges ahead for Tata Sons chairman N. Chandrasekaran in his third term, and India's possible responses to U.S. president Donald Trump's 50% tariff on Indian goods.

    "Title": "September '25 Car Sales: Maruti on top, this brand climbs to 2nd spot! - The Times of India",
    "Explanation": "September 2025 saw a mixed performance in India's car market. Maruti Suzuki retained dominance despite domestic sales dips, while Tata Motors achieved record sales, driven by Nexon, EV, and CNG models. Hyundai and Mahindra also posted strong growth, though Honda Cars India experienced a significant sales decline.The introduction of GST 2.0 and the onset of the festive season made September 2025 a crucial month for India's car market. However, the results were a mixed bag. While some brands rode the tax relief and festive demand to record-breaking numbers, others faced pressure in their entry-level offerings. The overall market also saw a reshuffle in rankings. Here's how the month has been for the major mass-market OEMs.At the top, Maruti Suzuki India continued its dominance with 189,665 units sold. The company's exports were the standout, hitting an all-time high of 42,204 units, up 52% from a year ago. However, domestic passenger vehicle sales slipped 8% to 132,820 units, weighed down by slower demand for entry-level cars and utility vehicles. Despite the dip, Maruti benefited from strong festive buying, clocking 1.65 lakh deliveries during Navratri's opening week, laying the ground for a busy October.The headline-grabber of the month, though, was Tata Motors. The homegrown giant recorded its best-ever monthly performance with 60,907 cars sold, surging 47% year-on-year. Leading the charge was the Nexon, which registered more than 22,500 units: the highest-ever monthly sales for any single Tata model. EV sales nearly doubled to 9,191 units, and CNG models scaled past 17,800 units.Meanwhile, Mahindra & Mahindra reported a 16% YoY increase in overall sales to 1,00,298 units. Within this, utility vehicles accounted for 56,233 units, a 10% rise, while exports grew 43% to 4,320 units.Hyundai Motor India had a strong month as well, posting 70,347 units, up 10% from last year. Domestic sales stood at 51,547 units. SUVs contributed a record 72.4% of Hyundai's volumes, with the Creta (18,861 units) notching its highest-ever sales and the Venue (11,484 units) hitting a 20-month high. Exports rose sharply to 18,800 units, a growth of 44% year-on-year.Other players also reported growth: Toyota Kirloskar Motor delivered 31,091 units, up 16% from last year, while Kia India sold 22,700 units, reflecting nearly 16% growth over August. JSW MG Motor India posted 6,728 units, up 34% year-on-year.Honda Cars India, however, saw sales drop 26% to 8,096 units, with domestic volumes at 5,303 units and exports at 2,793 units.",

    "Title": "Tata Motors Q2 FY26 Sales Commercial Vehicles Sales Registered by Tata Motors Ltd in Q2 FY26",
    "Explanation": "Sales in the domestic & international market for Q2 FY26 stood at 94,681 units, compared to 84,281 units during Q2 FY25.\n\nDomestic sales of MH&ICV in September 2025, was 15,669 units vs 14,190 units in September 2024; In Q2 FY26 it was 41,461 units, compared to 37,372 units in Q2 FY25.\n\nDomestic & International sales for MH&ICV in September 2025, was 16,759 units vs 14,839 units in September 2024; while in Q2 FY26 it stood at 45,095 units, vs 39,433 units in Q2 FY25.\n\nMr. Girish Wagh, Executive Director of Tata Motors Ltd., said, \"Q2 FY26 was a mixed quarter for the commercial vehicles industry, start marked by subdued market conditions and ending with a promising resurgence in demand. While July faced headwinds due to monsoon and August reflected cautious sentiment ahead of the GST 2.0 rollout, the onset of the festive season and lower GST rates from late September brought a good recovery in sales, bookings and sentiment.\n\nFollowing the GST reduction announcement, we acted swiftly and decisively to capture the growth in demand -- by enhancing product availability, sharpening our pricing strategy, and intensifying market activations. These initiatives helped us unlock demand across segments, making September our best-performing sales month in FY26, driven by a strong 30% YoY growth in our SCV and PU portfolio led by the new launches, Ace Pro and Ace Gold+.\n\nOverall, in Q2 FY26, Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles delivered sales of 94,681 units, registering a growth of 12% over the same period last year. We continue to build strong differentiation for our expansive range of trucks that now offer higher power output of up to 320hp. With smart engineering and a relentless focus on operational efficiency, our trucks remain the preferred choice for fleet owners seeking better performance, higher profits and long-term value.\n\nLooking ahead, with the festive season underway, improving consumption, and the full impact of GST reforms yet to unfold, we anticipate a strong second half for FY26. Construction, infrastructure, and mining activities will gain momentum, further fueling demand for trucks and tippers. With a robust pipeline of upcoming launches, and a richer, more customer-aligned product portfolio, we are well-positioned to accelerate this momentum and drive meaningful, broad-based growth across all commercial vehicles segments.\"\n\nPassenger Vehicles Sales Registered by Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd in Q2 FY26\n\nSales in the domestic & international market for Q2 FY26 stood at 144,397 units, compared to 130,753 units during Q2 FY25.\n\nIncludes sales of Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Limited, subsidiary of Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd.\n\nMr. Shailesh Chandra, Managing Director, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd. said, \"The passenger vehicles industry marked a sharp upswing in demand during September 2025 following the rollout of GST 2.0, further buoyed by festive tailwinds. This surge in demand sets a promising tone for sustained growth in the months ahead.\n\nFor Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles, September 2025 emerged as a watershed month with sales of 60,907 units (domestic wholesales of 59,667 units), our highest ever, marking a substantial 47% year-on-year growth. This milestone was complimented by record-breaking performances across our green fuel portfolio: EV sales surged 96%+ year-on-year to 9,191 units, setting a new benchmark, while CNG sales reached an all-time high of over 17,800 units, reflecting a remarkable 105%+ growth compared to Q2FY25.\n\nAcross our portfolio, customer interest remained exceptionally strong with new bookings doubling in the latter half of September following the lowering of GST rates. Leading this surge was the Nexon, which delivered a record-breaking performance with over 22,500 units sold in a single month, marking the highest-ever sales for any Tata Motors passenger vehicle. The Harrier and Safari continued their upward momentum, fueled by the rising popularity of their newly launched Adventure X edition and the availability of multiple powertrain options, leading to their best-ever combined sales. Additionally, the Punch continued to expand its widespread appeal, further cementing its status as the popular choice among customers in the compact SUV segment.\n\nIn Q2 FY26, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles delivered sales of 144,397 units, registering a robust, double-digit year-on-year (YoY) growth of more than 10%. While the entire product portfolio saw strong traction, our electric vehicle strategy stood out prominently. Quarterly EV sales surged 59% YoY to nearly 25,000 units, recording our highest-ever EV performance and contributing a record 17% to overall sales. This milestone underscores the growing consumer confidence in sustainable, zero-emission mobility. Additionally, our strategic foray into South Africa marked a significant milestone in our global expansion journey, with 5x export volumes compared to the previous year, highlighting the strength of our brand and product appeal in international markets.\n\nGoing forward, with a strong booking pipeline, agile supply readiness, and rising demand driven by festive cheer and accessible pricing, we are well-positioned to carry this growth momentum in H2 FY26.\"\n\nImportant Note: Pursuant to the Composite Scheme of Arrangement approved by the Hon'ble National Company Law Tribunal, effective October 1, 2025, Tata Motors has demerged its Commercial Vehicles business into TML Commercial Vehicles Limited (TMLCV), and consolidated the Passenger Vehicles business within the parent entity.\n\nSales figures referenced in this release pertain to the quarter ended September 30, 2025, prior to the scheme's effective date. Following the allotment and listing of TMLCV shares (record date for which has been fixed as October 14, 2025), both listed entities will independently publish their respective press releases going forward.",

    "Title": "Tata Group's last IPO had a multibagger at listing. Can Tata Capital repeat the feat?",
    "Explanation": "Tata Capital will launch its Rs 15,512 crore IPO on October 6. The company is India's third-largest diversified NBFC. It operates with the Tata brand backing and high credit ratings. Investors will consider its financial performance against market competition and its valuation. The IPO presents a long-term investment opportunity.\n\nThe Tata Group's upcoming IPO of Tata Capital is one of the most anticipated listings of 2025. If investors had to go by the strong parentage of Tata and other group stock performances, subscription to the IPO is a no brainer. The most recent listing from the group was a multibagger on debut. Tata Technologies hit the markets in November 2023, debuted at a 140% premium to its issue price. It was the first Tata Group IPO in nearly two decades, and sentiment was euphoric.\n\nBut the rally didn't sustain. Two years on, Tata Tech trades about 43% below its listing price, underlining how quick post-listing corrections can test even marquee names.\n\nNow, all eyes are on Tata Capital, the flagship financial services arm of Tata Sons, which opens its Rs 15,512 crore IPO on October 6. With a price band of Rs 310-326, the offer comprises a fresh issue of Rs 6,846 crore and an offer for sale worth Rs 8,666 crore by Tata Sons and IFC.\n\nTata Capital is India's third-largest diversified NBFC, with a gross loan book of Rs 2.33 lakh crore as of June 2025. Its loan mix is tilted towards retail and SME borrowers, who together account for over 87% of the book. The company operates through 1,516 branches and supplements its reach with 30,000 DSAs, 400 OEM tie-ups, and 60 digital partners.\n\nThe breadth of products -- over 25 lending solutions ranging from personal loans and home finance to vehicle, SME, and infrastructure loans -- gives Tata Capital an edge in diversification. Post its merger with Tata Motors Finance, the firm has expanded further into vehicle finance.\n\nBacked by the Tata brand, the company enjoys top-tier credit ratings -- 'AAA/stable' from leading agencies. This translates into competitive borrowing costs (7.8% average in FY25). Asset quality is among the best in its segment, with gross NPAs at 2.1% and net NPAs at 1% as of June 2025.\n\nFinancially, the company posted Rs 25,720 crore in interest income in FY25, up from Rs 16,366 crore in FY24. Net profit rose to Rs 3,655 crore, compared with Rs 3,327 crore the previous year. Net interest margins improved to 5.6%, while return ratios moderated post-merger but remain healthy (RoE at 12.6%, RoA at 1.8%).\n\nDespite its scale, Tata Capital faces intense competition from NBFC giants like Bajaj Finance and Shriram Finance. Its return ratios are lower than peers -- Bajaj Finance's RoE stands at 19.2% versus Tata Capital's 12.6%. Analysts also flag risks from high exposure to unsecured loans (20% of the book), possible asset-liability mismatches, and sensitivity to interest rate cycles.\n\nAnalysts remain positive but measured. SBI Securities notes that Tata Capital's strength of its parentage, diversified portfolio and omni-channel distribution make it a stable long-term play. Kunvarji Wealth, meanwhile, highlighted the company's strong brand equity, growth trajectory and robust risk management framework.\n\nHowever, both point out that valuations -- at 3.4 times post-issue book value -- are not cheap. Returns will hinge on how the company integrates its vehicle finance business and sustains profitability amid competition.\n\nFor investors, the Tata brand brings comfort. But as Tata Technologies showed, a blockbuster listing doesn't always ensure lasting gains. Tata Capital's IPO may not deliver the fireworks of Tata Tech's debut, but with its scale, brand trust and improving fundamentals, it positions itself as a steadier, more long-term bet.\n\n(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

    "Title": "Tata Motors demerger: No capital gains tax on receipt but be careful when you sell",
    "Explanation": "The demerger of Tata Motors, effective October 1, will separate the automotive major's commercial vehicle (CV) and passenger vehicle (PV) businesses into two independent listed companies.\n\nThose holding shares of Tata Motors on October 14 , the record date, will get one equity share of the new CV company for every one share they hold in Tata Motors. TML Commercial Vehicles Ltd is expected to list by early November.\n\nMoneycontrol takes a look at how capital gains tax works on sale of shares after a demerger:\n\nThe cost of acquisition\n\nWhen a company demerges and you receive new shares, it's not \"free\" stock. You need to split your original cost of acquisition between the original company and the new one based on their net book values (NBV), not on the market price.\n\n\"Listed companies generally disclose the exact apportionment ratio in their corporate announcements or through exchanges. Investors should simply apply that ratio to their original purchase price,\" said Kunal Sharma, founder & managing partner, Taraksh Lawyers & Consultants.\n\n\"Most companies publish this ratio, for example 60:40, either in their scheme of arrangement or via communications from the registrar and Transfer Agent (RTA). So if you bought shares for Rs 1,000 originally, Rs 600 becomes the cost of the old company and Rs 400 becomes the cost for the new one. This is the simplest, most accurate way to do it even for small investors,\" said Shreya Jaiswal, chartered accountant and founder, Fawkes Solutions, a brand strategy firm.\n\nThe same methodology will apply when Tata Motors' percentage ratio for NBV is announced.\n\nAs of now, at the time you get these new shares on demerger, there is no tax implication. You just have a new share in your demat account and you have to disclose the purchase price.\n\nSection 47(vib)/(vid)/(vb) of the income-tax act provides a clear relief: the transfer of shares under a scheme of demerger is not treated as a taxable transfer in the hands of shareholders.\n\n\"This means that simply receiving shares of the resulting company does not trigger capital gains tax. Tax arises only when the investor actually sells the shares,\" Sharma said.\n\nFor retail investors, there is no special exemption beyond this. The cost of acquisition is apportioned under Section 49(2C)/(2D), and the holding period carries over.\n\nHolding period and capital gains\n\n\"When shares are eventually sold, capital gains are computed in the usual way, based on the split cost and carried-over holding period,\" Sharma said.\n\nIn a demerger, the law ensures continuity. Section 2(42A) of the I-T act says the holding period of the resulting company's shares is deemed to include the holding period of the parent company's shares. Simply put, the \"clock\" does not restart.\n\n\"Thus, if an investor had held the parent shares for more than 12 months before the demerger, both the parent and the resulting company's shares will qualify as long-term,\" Sharma said.\n\nEven where the parent shares were acquired in different lots, the respective acquisition dates of those lots continue for the proportionate demerged shares. For retail investors, the guiding principle is simple: the age of your shares remains the same after a demerger.\n\nThis means that your holding period doesn't reset after a demerger. If you bought shares in 2021 and the demerger happened in 2023, the holding period for both the old and new company counts from 2021. \"This matters because it often pushes your gains into the long-term capital gains (LTCG) bracket, which is taxed more favourably. Many investors don't realise this and end up misreporting or overpaying tax,\" Jaiswal said.\n\nIn case both Tata Motors and the demerged company declare dividends separately, tax will be deducted at source, and the dividend will be taxed as income from other sources. \"This is the standard taxation, separate from capital gains, so investors need to account for it while filing returns,\" said Vivek Jalan, partner, Tax Connect Advisory Services.\n\nAvoid penalties: track demerged shares right\n\nKeep the original communication from the company or RTA that shows the NBV ratio. Label your shares manually in your demat spreadsheet or in your trading account. When you sell, cross-check your cost basis with what you initially calculated not just what the platform tells you.\n\n\"If you're filing your return, report these sales properly under Schedule 112A. Many tax software platforms support this now but your numbers need to be correct,\" said Jaiswal.",

    "Title": "Stock markets decline in early trade dragged by foreign fund outflows, banking counters - The Sen Times",
    "Explanation": "Mumbai, Oct 3 (PTI) Benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty fell in early trade on Friday as relentless foreign fund outflows and selling in blue-chip bank stocks dragged the markets lower.\n\nThe 30-share BSE Sensex declined 299.17 points to 80,684.14 in opening trade. The 50-share NSE Nifty dropped 76.75 points to 24,759.55.\n\nFrom the Sensex firms, Mahindra & Mahindra, Bajaj Finserv, UltraTech Cement, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance, Trent, ICICI Bank and Maruti were among the major laggards.\n\nHowever, Tata Steel, Axis Bank, Tata Motors and Bharat Electronics were among the gainers.\n\nForeign Institutional Investors (FIIs) offloaded equities worth Rs 1,605.20 crore on Wednesday, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) bought stocks worth Rs 2,916.14 crore, according to exchange data.\n\n\"The positive impact of the central bank's bold initiatives to boost credit growth in the economy has the potential to sustain the momentum in the market, particularly in Bank Nifty. But this momentum is unlikely to sustain in the context of persistent FII selling in the market.\n\n\"FIIs are likely to further accelerate selling since the market construct provides them the opportunity to sell aggressively. The huge short position in the market indicates that the bulls will be on the defensive,\" VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Ltd, said.\n\nIn Asian markets, South Korea's Kospi and Japan's Nikkei 225 index were trading sharply higher, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index quoted lower.\n\nUS markets ended higher on Thursday.\n\nGlobal oil benchmark Brent crude climbed 0.59 per cent to USD 64.49 a barrel.\n\nEquity markets were closed on Thursday for Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti and Dussehra.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Sensex jumped 715.69 points or 0.89 per cent to settle at 80,983.31, and the Nifty climbed 225.20 points or 0.92 per cent to 24,836.30.",

    "Title": "Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Tata Motors, Mahindra: PV sales snapshot september 2025",
    "Explanation": "The September 2025 sales chart for India's passenger vehicle (PV) market isn't just a list of numbers; it's a strategy ledger. Beneath the surface of early festive cheer and GST 2.0 nudges, a complex, almost defensive game is being played by the top four, and what stands out is the growing anxiety about domestic growth. Here's the true read on what the Big Four are signaling.\n\nLet's get to the point: The 8 per cent domestic sales decline of Maruti Suzuki is the key takeaway, a clear indicator that the ground is indeed slipping from under their feet as competition is heating up. The golden days of easy volume growth in the domestic market are behind us.\n\nBut to regard their export boom to an all-time high of 42,200 units as a footnote, or a mere 'red flag', is to overlook the long-game strategic genius. Maruti is not merely exporting excess inventory abroad; they are proactively leveraging their gigantic production scale to de-risk the entire business model. This export boom is a very efficient, scripted hedge against volatility in the domestic market.\n\nThe 4 per cent month-on-month (MoM) uptick in total sales from August is proof that this dual-focus strategy is working as intended. While the workhorses like the Brezza, Dzire, and WagonR continue to keep the domestic lights on, the global market is providing the necessary structural buoyancy. The question isn't whether they're slowing down, but how effectively they've engineered a safety valve for when domestic momentum inevitably softens.\n\nHyundai and Mahindra are essentially in a race to see who can build the better SUV fortress.\n\nHyundai's numbers are staggering: SUVs now account for over 70 per cent of their domestic sales, powered by the Creta and Venue. This is a brilliant, opportunistic pivot that capitalizes on both buyer preference and the GST 2.0 benefits. Their 3.3 per cent MoM growth is clean, steady, and entirely driven by utility. The risk? They are becoming dangerously dependent on a single body style. What happens when, inevitably, the Indian buyer's preference swings back, even partially, toward sedans or premium hatchbacks? Their portfolio breadth, once a strength, is now being overshadowed by this SUV obsession.\n\nMahindra, meanwhile, is content in its domain. The brand is built on rugged, premium SUVs, and they are holding the line with a solid 3.5 per cent MoM growth and 56,200 domestic sales. Their low export numbers (500 units) reaffirm their ultra-focused domestic strategy. They aren't trying to be all things to all people; they are purely the SUV specialist. It's a high-margin, stable model, but it lacks the scale-up potential of their rivals.\n\nThe real story of September belongs to Tata Motors. They didn't just sell well; they overtook Hyundai and Mahindra with 58,000 domestic units, executing a strategic masterpiece powered by EVs and CNG. Their 4.2 per cent MoM rise is the strongest and most strategically sound of the group.\n\nThis is the sound of market consolidation, not just cyclical buying. Tata is winning because they have correctly identified two things: first, that alternative fuels are the growth engine (aided by policy and discounts), and second, that they can command domestic loyalty. The single-day record of 10,000 sales proves that pricing, green technology, and festival timing create a demand multiplier that their rivals are struggling to match. Their strategy is firmly rooted in transforming the Indian buyer's vehicle choice, not just selling them another car.\n\nSeptember 2025 shows us an industry shedding its old skin. Volume is secondary to strategic alignment.",

    "Title": "Tata Motors Gains On Demerger Boost, Strong Sales: SEBI Analyst Eyes Breakout Near ₹754",
    "Explanation": "Meanwhile, Jaguar Land Rover began a phased recovery after a cyber-attack disrupted production at its UK plants through most of September.\n\nShares of Tata Motors rose around 1% on Friday after the company's demerger became effective on October 1. The automobile major has separated its commercial vehicle (CV) and passenger vehicle (PV) divisions into two independent entities.\n\nAdd Asianet Newsable as a Preferred Source\n\nOne company will now manage the PV business, covering cars, SUVs, electric vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover, while the other will handle CVs such as trucks, buses and heavy machines.\n\nInvestors holding Tata Motors shares on October 14, the record date, will receive one equity share of the new commercial vehicle company for every Tata Motors share held. The new entity, TML Commercial Vehicles Ltd, is expected to list by early November.\n\nSeptember Sales Performance\n\nThe company's September sales reached a record 60,907 units, a 47% year-on-year increase, while electric vehicle sales nearly doubled to 9,191 units. Overall sales for July-September stood at 94,681 units, up 12% from the previous year, driven by strong demand, particularly in the EV segment.\n\nTata Motors: Technical View\n\nAccording to SEBI-registered analyst Mayank Singh Chandel, Tata Motors' stock had been in a downtrend since August 2024, but since April 2025, buyers have stepped in, forming higher lows and showing renewed strength. The stock rose 5.61% on Wednesday, indicating fresh momentum.\n\nHe added that the key resistance zone lies between ₹730 and ₹754, which has been difficult to cross in the past. A decisive breakout above ₹754 could open the way for a stronger rally and fresh buying opportunities, he said.\n\nJLR Cyber-Attack Concerns\n\nMeanwhile, Jaguar Land Rover halted production at its three UK plants from August 31 after a cyber-attack disrupted internal systems, keeping operations down for most of September. The Tata Motors subsidiary announced a phased restart on Sept. 29, with full recovery expected to take several weeks.\n\nDespite the disruption, September retail sales remained unaffected, with some wholesale deliveries managed at a lower rate.\n\nThe company said it expects a temporary liquidity impact from the production halt but added that the US market remains resilient, China is holding steady, and the EU/UK markets are stable.\n\nWhat Is The Retail Mood?\n\nOn Stocktwits, retail sentiment was 'neutral' amid 'high' message volume.\n\nTata Motors' stock has declined 3.8% so far in 2025.\n\nFor updates and corrections, email newsroom[at]stocktwits[dot]com.<\n\nRead Full Article",

    "Title": "Nifty under stress; India domestic stories shine | India Infoline",
    "Explanation": "After falling in July and August, the Nifty 50 showed a marginal recovery of 0.75% in September 2025, largely driven by domestically oriented stocks like banking, autos, and metals. While September was the first full month of 50% tariffs, it also saw the H1-B visa fee hiked nearly 50-fold to $1,00,000 or approximately ₹89 lakhs. For the month of September, FPIs were net sellers in equities to the tune of $2.71 Billion, after selling $3.00 Billion in August 2025. With tariffs clearly hitting exports, focus has shifted to predominantly domestic stories like banking, autos, and metals. These were the stocks that outperformed in the month of September 2025, amidst the global headwinds.\n\nMOMENTUM RETURNS - DOMESTIC STORIES HOLD NIFTY IN SEP-25\n\nNifty was up 0.75% in September 2025, with 27 gainers and 23 losers in terms of 1-month returns. While the positive side returns averaged 5.60%, the negative side returns averaged -3.69%, triggered by FMCG and IT stocks. Here are top-15 on monthly returns.\n\nData Source: NSE\n\nWhich are the sectors that showed momentum in the last one month? The top 15 stocks had 5 Financial Stocks, 3 Metal Stocks, 3 Auto Stocks, while the others were sectorally spread out. The predominance of auto and financials was due to expectations of more rate cuts by the RBI as well as a specific India story. Metal stocks gained from the Involution Plans of the Chinese government as well as improving Indo-China trade relations.\n\nLONGER TERM RETURNS - NIFTY STORY FOR YEAR TO SEPTEMBER 2025\n\nWith Nifty index 1-Year returns at -5.99% in September 2025, there were 18 gainers and 32 losers. While the positive side returns were 10.92%, the negative side were -18.30%. Here are the top-15 on Annual Returns.\n\nData Source: NSE\n\nWhich Nifty stock segments showed best long term returns? The top 15 stocks by 1-year returns had 4 BFSI companies, 3 Auto stocks, 2 Consumer Stocks, and 2 Metal Stocks. If you look at the bottom 15, there were deep cuts in IT and FMCG stocks. Some of the big hits in the year include stocks like Trent, TCS, Asian Paints, Infosys, HCL Tech, and ITC Ltd.

      "body": "After falling in July and August, the Nifty 50 showed a marginal recovery of 0.75% in September 2025, largely driven by domestically oriented stocks like banking, autos, and metals. While September was the first full month of 50% tariffs, it also saw the H1-B visa fee hiked nearly 50-fold to $1,00,000 or approximately ₹89 lakhs. For the month of September, FPIs were net sellers in equities to the tune of $2.71 Billion, after selling $3.00 Billion in August 2025. With tariffs clearly hitting exports, focus has shifted to predominantly domestic stories like banking, autos, and metals. These were the stocks that outperformed in the month of September 2025, amidst the global headwinds.\n\nMOMENTUM RETURNS - DOMESTIC STORIES HOLD NIFTY IN SEP-25\n\nNifty was up 0.75% in September 2025, with 27 gainers and 23 losers in terms of 1-month returns. While the positive side returns averaged 5.60%, the negative side returns averaged -3.69%, triggered by FMCG and IT stocks. Here are top-15 on monthly returns.\n\nData Source: NSE\n\nWhich are the sectors that showed momentum in the last one month? The top 15 stocks had 5 Financial Stocks, 3 Metal Stocks, 3 Auto Stocks, while the others were sectorally spread out. The predominance of auto and financials was due to expectations of more rate cuts by the RBI as well as a specific India story. Metal stocks gained from the Involution Plans of the Chinese government as well as improving Indo-China trade relations.\n\nLONGER TERM RETURNS - NIFTY STORY FOR YEAR TO SEPTEMBER 2025\n\nWith Nifty index 1-Year returns at -5.99% in September 2025, there were 18 gainers and 32 losers. While the positive side returns were 10.92%, the negative side were -18.30%. Here are the top-15 on Annual Returns.\n\nData Source: NSE\n\nWhich Nifty stock segments showed best long term returns? The top 15 stocks by 1-year returns had 4 BFSI companies, 3 Auto stocks, 2 Consumer Stocks, and 2 Metal Stocks. If you look at the bottom 15, there were deep cuts in IT and FMCG stocks. Some of the big hits in the year include stocks like Trent, TCS, Asian Paints, Infosys, HCL Tech, and ITC Ltd. In fact, several PSUs like NTPC, Coal India, and Power Grid have also lagged in the last 1 year.\n\nNIFTY BOUNCE SHOWS RESILIENCE IN SEPTEMBER 2025\n\nA proxy for resilience is the extent of bounce from 52-Week lows.

    "Explanation": "MUMBAI: The Indian benchmark indices opened with mild losses on Friday due to sustained FII selling, despite positive global cues and market optimism driven by the Reserve Bank of India's dovish pause.\n\nAs of 9.20 am, the Sensex was down 191 points, or 0.24 per cent at 80, 792 and the Nifty declined 56 points, or 0.23 per cent at 24, 780.\n\nThe broad cap indices, Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Smallcap 100, inched up 0.22 and 0.14 per cent respectively. Tata Steel, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Tata Motors and Asian Paints were among major gainers on the Nifty pack, while losers included Max Healthcare, Bajaj Finance, Shriram Finance and ICICI Bank, among others.\n\nAmong sectoral indices, Nifty Metal, the top gainer, advanced 0.89 per cent. Nifty PSU Bank (up 0.59 per cent) and Nifty Pharma (up 0.30 per cent) were other major gainers. Nifty Media and Nifty FMCG were the top losers down 0.65 per cent and 0.45 per cent respectively.\n\nAnalysts said that from a technical perspective, a sustained move above 24, 900 could pave the way for a rally toward 25, 000 and 25, 150. The immediate support is placed at 24, 750 and 24, 600, which may act as potential entry points for long trades.\n\nThe US markets ended in the green zone overnight, as Nasdaq edged up 0.39 per cent, the S&amp;P 500 added 0.06 per cent, and the Dow moved up 0.17 per cent in the last trading session.\n\nAsia-Pacific markets mostly rose Friday, tracking Wall Street gains as investors shrugged off the US government shutdown. Investors are waiting to see how long the shutdown will last to assess the gravity of its economic repercussions.",

      "body": "MUMBAI: The Indian benchmark indices opened with mild losses on Friday due to sustained FII selling, despite positive global cues and market optimism driven by the Reserve Bank of India's dovish pause.\n\nAs of 9.20 am, the Sensex was down 191 points, or 0.24 per cent at 80, 792 and the Nifty declined 56 points, or 0.23 per cent at 24, 780.\n\nThe broad cap indices, Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Smallcap 100, inched up 0.22 and 0.14 per cent respectively. Tata Steel, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Tata Motors and Asian Paints were among major gainers on the Nifty pack, while losers included Max Healthcare, Bajaj Finance, Shriram Finance and ICICI Bank, among others.\n\nAmong sectoral indices, Nifty Metal, the top gainer, advanced 0.89 per cent. Nifty PSU Bank (up 0.59 per cent) and Nifty Pharma (up 0.30 per cent) were other major gainers. Nifty Media and Nifty FMCG were the top losers down 0.65 per cent and 0.45 per cent respectively.\n\nAnalysts said that from a technical perspective, a sustained move above 24, 900 could pave the way for a rally toward 25, 000 and 25, 150. The immediate support is placed at 24, 750 and 24, 600, which may act as potential entry points for long trades.\n\nThe US markets ended in the green zone overnight, as Nasdaq edged up 0.39 per cent, the S&amp;P 500 added 0.06 per cent, and the Dow moved up 0.17 per cent in the last trading session.\n\nAsia-Pacific markets mostly rose Friday, tracking Wall Street gains as investors shrugged off the US government shutdown. Investors are waiting to see how long the shutdown will last to assess the gravity of its economic repercussions.",

    "Title": "Sensex, Nifty open lower over sustained FII selling",
    "Explanation": "Mumbai: The Indian benchmark indices opened with mild losses on Friday due to sustained FII selling, despite positive global cues and market optimism driven by the Reserve Bank of India's dovish pause.\n\nAs of 9.20 am, the Sensex was down 191 points, or 0.24 per cent at 80,792 and the Nifty declined 56 points, or 0.23 per cent at 24,780.\n\nThe broad cap indices, Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Smallcap 100, inched up 0.22 and 0.14 per cent respectively. Tata Steel, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Tata Motors and Asian Paints were among major gainers on the Nifty pack, while losers included Max Healthcare, Bajaj Finance, Shriram Finance and ICICI Bank, among others.\n\nAmong sectoral indices, Nifty Metal, the top gainer, advanced 0.89 per cent. Nifty PSU Bank (up 0.59 per cent) and Nifty Pharma (up 0.30 per cent) were other major gainers. Nifty Media and Nifty FMCG were the top losers down 0.65 per cent and 0.45 per cent respectively.\n\nFollow for more details: munsifdaily.com\n\nAnalysts said that from a technical perspective, a sustained move above 24,900 could pave the way for a rally toward 25,000 and 25,150. The immediate support is placed at 24,750 and 24,600, which may act as potential entry points for long trades.\n\nThe US markets ended in the green zone overnight, as Nasdaq edged up 0.39 per cent, the S&amp;P 500 added 0.06 per cent, and the Dow moved up 0.17 per cent in the last trading session.\n\nAsia-Pacific markets mostly rose Friday, tracking Wall Street gains as investors shrugged off the US government shutdown. Investors are waiting to see how long the shutdown will last to assess the gravity of its economic repercussions.\n\nAlso Read: Owaisi Criticizes RSS Role in Freedom Struggle, Responds to PM Modi's Praise\n\nWhile China's Shanghai index added 0.52 per cent, and Shenzhen advanced 0.35 per cent, Japan's Nikkei added 1.44 per cent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index declined 0.84 per cent. South Korea's Kospi added 2.70 per cent.\n\nAnalysts said that the central bank's bold initiatives to boost credit growth in the economy can positively sustain the momentum in the market, particularly in Bank Nifty. However, the sustained selling by FIIs in the market is unlikely to sustain this momentum.\n\nFIIs are likely to further accelerate selling since the market construct provides them the opportunity to sell aggressively. Robust buying from DIIs can provide some support to the market, particularly in large-cap auto stocks, which have strong fundamental support now, they added.\n\nIn the last trading session on Wednesday, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold equities worth Rs 1,605 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) were net buyers of equities worth Rs 2,916 crore.",

    "Explanation": "Mumbai- Benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty fell in early trade on Friday as relentless foreign fund outflows and selling in blue-chip bank stocks dragged the markets lower.\n\nThe 30-share BSE Sensex declined 299.17 points to 80,684.14 in opening trade. The 50-share NSE Nifty dropped 76.75 points to 24,759.55.\n\nFrom the Sensex firms, Mahindra & Mahindra, Bajaj Finserv, UltraTech Cement, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance, Trent, ICICI Bank and Maruti were among the major laggards.\n\nHowever, Tata Steel, Axis Bank, Tata Motors and Bharat Electronics were among the gainers.\n\nForeign Institutional Investors (FIIs) offloaded equities worth Rs 1,605.20 crore on Wednesday, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) bought stocks worth Rs 2,916.14 crore, according to exchange data.\n\n\"The positive impact of the central bank's bold initiatives to boost credit growth in the economy has the potential to sustain the momentum in the market, particularly in Bank Nifty. But this momentum is unlikely to sustain in the context of persistent FII selling in the market.\n\n\"FIIs are likely to further accelerate selling since the market construct provides them the opportunity to sell aggressively. The huge short position in the market indicates that the bulls will be on the defensive,\" VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Ltd, said.\n\nIn Asian markets, South Korea's Kospi and Japan's Nikkei 225 index were trading sharply higher, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index quoted lower.\n\nUS markets ended higher on Thursday.\n\nGlobal oil benchmark Brent crude climbed 0.59 per cent to USD 64.49 a barrel.\n\nEquity markets were closed on Thursday for Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti and Dussehra.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Sensex jumped 715.69 points or 0.89 per cent to settle at 80,983.31, and the Nifty climbed 225.20 points or 0.92 per cent to 24,836.30.BUSINESSMUMBAI",
