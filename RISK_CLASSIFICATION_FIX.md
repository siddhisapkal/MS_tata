# 🔧 Risk Classification Fix - Field Name Error

## ❌ **Issue Fixed:**
**Error:** `'title'` KeyError when fetching/analyzing smart filtered news

## 🔍 **Root Cause:**
The code was using inconsistent field names:
- Articles were stored with `'Title'` (uppercase)
- But accessed with `'title'` (lowercase)
- Same issue with `'content'` vs `'Explanation'`

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**

### 1. **Fixed Field Name Consistency:**
```python
# BEFORE (causing error):
title_lower = article['title'].lower()  # ❌ 'title' doesn't exist
content_lower = article.get('content', '').lower()  # ❌ 'content' doesn't exist

# AFTER (fixed):
title_lower = article['Title'].lower()  # ✅ Correct field name
content_lower = article.get('Explanation', '').lower()  # ✅ Correct field name
```

### 2. **Improved Risk Type Priority:**
- **Operational** risks (recalls, defects) now checked FIRST
- **Supply Chain** risks checked second
- **Regulatory** risks checked third
- This ensures recalls are classified as "Operational" not "Supply Chain"

### 3. **Test Results:**
✅ **Supply Chain** - Semiconductor shortage articles
✅ **Regulatory** - FAME scheme articles  
✅ **Operational** - Recall articles (now correctly classified)
✅ **Competitive** - Competitor analysis articles
✅ **Financial** - Revenue growth articles

## 🎯 **Expected Results Now:**

Your dashboard will now show diverse risk types:
- **🔗 Supply Chain** - For shortage, disruption articles
- **📋 Regulatory** - For policy, government articles
- **⚙️ Operational** - For recall, safety articles
- **💻 Technology** - For innovation, tech articles
- **🏆 Competitive** - For competitor articles
- **💰 Financial** - For revenue, investment articles
- **🔒 Cybersecurity** - For security articles
- **🌱 Environmental** - For sustainability articles
- **📊 Strategic** - For demerger, restructuring articles

## 🚀 **Ready to Test:**

1. **Go to**: `http://localhost:8502`
2. **Search**: Try "lithium shortage" or "recall"
3. **Fetch News**: Click "📰 Fetch & Analyze News"
4. **See Results**: You'll now see diverse, accurate risk types!
