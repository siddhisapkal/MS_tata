    "Title": "India witnesses record Navratri sales in a decade amid GST reforms",
    "Explanation": "India achieved its highest Navratri sales in over a decade, propelled by government GST reforms that lowered prices and boosted consumer aspirations. This led to record consumption, with major auto and electronics companies like Maruti Suzuki, M&M, Hyundai, LG, and Haier reporting their best-ever festive season performance.\n\nIndia saw its highest Navratri sales in over a decade propelled by the government's GST reforms that reduced tax rates and made products more accessible, as per government sources.\n\nSources said these measures lowered prices and boosted consumer aspirations, enabling families to upgrade vehicles, invest in home appliances, and spend more freely on lifestyle goods, turning festive cheer into record-breaking consumption.\n\nET reported in its Friday edition that leading companies including Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindra, Reliance Retail, Hyundai, LG Electronics and Haier have clocked decade's best sales during this year's Navratri.\n\nCiting data, government sources said Maruti Suzuki's Navratri sales grew 100%, which doubled from last year. The company reported 3.5 lakh bookings with nearly 2.5 lakh pending bookings. By end of the Navratri period, it is confident of touching the 2 lakh mark in deliveries as compared to 85,000 vehicles retailed last Navratri.\n\nM&M reported a retail jump of 60% year-on-year, as per the sources. At Hyundai, the surge in demand for models like Creta and Venue pushed SUVs' share of total sales to over 72%.\n\nShowroom footfalls of two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp have doubled this Navratri with high traction in the commuter segment. Tata Motors retailed more than 50,000 vehicles during the festive period, with demand from Altroz, Punch, Nexon and Tiago models. Bajaj Auto also reported strong sales during Navratri, government sources said.\n\nIn the consumer electronics space, LG, Haier and Godrej Appliances reported high double-digit sales growth. For instance, Haier's sales soared 85%, nearly selling out its Diwali stock of 85-inch and 100-inch TVs priced above ₹2.5 lakh.",

    "Title": "Auto companies face logistical woes amid festive rush - The Times of India",
    "Explanation": "NEW DELHI: The festive rush is there but car and two-wheeler companies, flush with orders after GST reduction and price cuts, are now facing a unique problem -- 'on time delivery' of vehicles during festivals.While customers are seeking delivery around Dhanteras and Diwali, companies are finding it challenging to do so due to shortage of trucks and trailers. The shortage of rare earth magnets, despite initial assurances around normalisation of supplies from China, is also delaying production, particularly of electrics and two-wheelers.Industry officials told TOI that sudden rush in demand for deliveries -- across automobiles, FMCG, ecommerce, fashion and lifestyle segments -- has put a huge pressure on the truck industry with fleets working round-the-clock to deliver across the country. \"Add to this the usual gifting rush around Diwali and you have a problem that is increasingly becoming very challenging to solve,\" an industry official said.\"Surge in festive demand has led to significant constraints on availability of trailers. We are working to improve dispatches to our dealer network within constraints,\" Nalinikanth Gollagunta, CEO, automotive division, M&M said.The same situation is being faced by Maruti, which has seen a huge recovery in demand for small cars after GST cut. \"We have pending deliveries of 2.5 lakh vehicles, and most people prefer it around Diwali . We are working overtime and are now using railways to ensure that dispatches happen faster and on time,\" Partho Banerjee, senior executive officer (marketing & sales) at Maruti Suzuki, said.Amit Kamat, chief commercial officer at Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles, said surge in demand for trailers and trucks began after Sept 22 as new GST rates came into play. \"We expect this surge to be temporary and are working with logistics partners to expedite dispatches... Despite challenges, we are working tirelessly to expedite deliveries to our dealerships in time for Diwali celebrations.\"Luxury players, such as BMW, are also feeling the pinch due to sudden rush in demand. \"Customers like to take the delivery on Dhanteras and Diwali. This year, demand for deliveries on these specific days is much higher as pent-up demand from Aug-Sept is also coming into play... When the bottleneck suddenly opened, there were certain logistics challenges in the start, but they are streamlined now,\" Hardeep Singh Brar, president and CEO of BMW Group India, said.It's similar for two-wheeler industry. Apart from logistics, companies are also plagued by shortage of magnets. \"The cut in retail prices has meant that there has been a sudden rise in demand for scooters and motorcycles. Rare earth magnet issue is hampering production. Sudden rush in bookings is leading to pressure on deliveries,\" a top official of a leading company said.",

    "Title": "India Sees Record Navratri Sales as GST Cuts and Swadeshi Push Boost Festive Consumption",
    "Explanation": "India recorded its highest Navratri sales in more than a decade, with consumer demand surging across automobiles, electronics, and lifestyle goods, as recent tax reforms and a growing preference for domestic products lifted festive sentiment.\n\nIndustry players and trade bodies reported sales growth ranging between 25% and 100% during the nine-day festival, crediting the government's cuts in Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates for lowering prices and expanding access to aspirational products. The surge comes at the start of the month-long Diwali season, with traders projecting record sales of ₹4.75 lakh crore this year -- up from ₹4.25 lakh crore in 2024.\n\nAuto sector leads the charge\n\nCarmaker Maruti Suzuki posted its best-ever Navratri sales in at least a decade, doubling year-on-year volumes. The company reported 150,000 bookings and expects to reach 200,000, with 1.65 lakh deliveries in just eight days. On the first day alone, Maruti delivered 30,000 cars, marking its strongest single-day performance in 35 years.\n\nSUV maker Mahindra & Mahindra saw retail sales rise 60%, while Hyundai reported SUVs accounting for over 72% of total sales, driven by Creta and Venue models. Tata Motors retailed more than 50,000 vehicles, led by demand for the Altroz, Punch, Nexon, and Tiago. Two-wheeler leader Hero MotoCorp reported a doubling of showroom footfalls, and Bajaj Auto also logged strong sales momentum.\n\nConsumer electronics boom\n\nFestive demand also buoyed the electronics sector. Haier saw sales soar 85%, nearly exhausting its Diwali stock of large-screen TVs, while LG and Godrej Appliances reported double-digit growth. Reliance Retail posted a 20-25% increase, led by smartphones, fashion, and TVs, while Vijay Sales also reported sales growth above 20%.\n\nTraders eye record Diwali season\n\nThe Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) projected Diwali sales to cross ₹4.75 lakh crore, citing both tax reforms and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call for \"Vocal for Local - Local for Global\" as key drivers. CAIT's survey of 35 cities found strong consumer preference for Indian-made goods across categories ranging from clay lamps and handicrafts to automobiles, electronics, and FMCG products.\n\n\"Every rupee spent on Indian goods this Diwali strengthens the economy, generates jobs, and fulfills the vision of a self-reliant India,\" said CAIT Secretary General and MP Praveen Khandelwal at a press conference in New Delhi. He described this year's festival as \"Apni Diwali - Bharatiya Diwali\", underscoring the growing Swadeshi sentiment.\n\nChinese imports sidelined\n\nThe shift away from Chinese goods -- a trend that has gathered momentum since the 2020 Galwan Valley clash -- has intensified, with traders saying Diwali markets this year are dominated by Indian-made products. Categories such as home décor, textiles, toys, and puja items are seeing a surge in demand for Swadeshi alternatives.\n\nA consumption-driven boost\n\nThe festive calendar, stretching from Navratri through Diwali and Chhath Puja, accounts for 40-45% of annual retail sales. This year's record numbers signal a broader boost for India's consumption-driven economy at a time when global growth remains uncertain.\n\nEconomists say GST rationalisation, combined with pent-up demand and a cultural shift toward local goods, has amplified consumer confidence. With decorated bazaars, swelling footfalls, and record order books, India's 2025 festive season appears set to cement its place as both a celebration of tradition and a showcase of economic momentum.",

    "Explanation": "Tata Capital secured Rs 4,641 crore from anchor investors including LIC, mutual funds and global institutions ahead of its Rs 15,512-crore IPO, the largest-ever NBFC issue\n\nTata Capital on Friday allotted 142.4 million shares to anchor investors, raising Rs 4,641 crore. The shares were allotted at Rs 326 apiece, the top end of the price band.\n\nAmong the prominent anchor investors, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) received the largest allotment of over 21.4 million shares, committing close to Rs 700 crore. Domestic mutual funds accounted for 35.55 per cent of the total anchor allocation, with over 50 million shares distributed across 18 mutual funds and 59 schemes.\n\nNotable mutual fund participants included ICICI Prudential, HDFC Mutual Fund, Aditya Birla Sun Life, DSP, Axis Mutual Fund, Nippon India, Edelweiss, Kotak and Motilal Oswal.\n\nForeign institutional investors such as Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and the State of Michigan Retirement System also featured prominently among the anchor investors, each receiving substantial allocations.\n\nTata Capital's Rs 15,512-crore IPO -- the fourth largest in the domestic market and the biggest-ever non-banking finance company (NBFC) offering -- opens for public subscription on Monday.\n\nAlso Read\n\nIPO-bound Tata Capital focuses on green financing, tech for growth\n\nIPO Calendar: Tata Capital, LG India to open; 29 listings next week\n\nCan Tata Capital IPO, Tata Motors demerger lift sentiment of group stocks?\n\nTata Investment shares up for 3rd day on heavy volumes, zoom 32% in 6 days\n\nWant more retail investors in Tata Capital story: MD & CEO Rajiv Sabharwalpremium\n\nThe IPO comprises a fresh issue of shares worth Rs 6,846 crore, which will be used to augment the company's capital base.

It is also the biggest IPO in the domestic market since Hyundai Motor India's record Rs 27,869-crore issue in June 2024.\n\nClassified as an \"upper layer\" NBFC by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Tata Capital was mandated to list.\n\nEstablished in 2007, Tata Capital has grown into India's third-largest NBFC, with a loan book of Rs 2.33 trillion as of June 2025. Its portfolio is diversified, with retail loans accounting for 61.3 per cent, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) 26.2 per cent and corporate loans 12.5 per cent.\n\nThe recent merger with Tata Motors Finance, a leading commercial vehicle financier with assets under management (AUM) of Rs 36,515 crore as of December 2024, has further strengthened its position.

    "Title": "Auto cos in a bind as customers scramble for festive deliveries amid logistics crunch - The Times of India",
    "Explanation": "NEW DELHI: The festive rush is there but car and two-wheeler companies, flush with orders post the price cuts after the GST reduction, are now facing a unique problem - 'on time delivery' of vehicles during the festivals.While customers are seeking delivery during the auspicious period of Dhanteras and around Diwali, companies are increasingly finding it challenging to do so due to shortage of trucks and trailers. The shortage of rare earth magnets, which happens despite initial assurances around normalisation of supplies from China, is also delaying production, particularly of electrics and two-wheelers.Industry officials told TOI that the sudden rush in demand for deliveries - across industries such as automobiles, FMCG, ecommerce, fashion and lifestyle - has put a huge pressure on the trucking industry with trucking fleets working round-the-clock to deliver across the length and breadth of the country. \"Add to this the usual gifting rush around Diwali and you have a problem that is increasingly becoming very challenging to solve,\" an industry official said.The pressure on the auto companies is telling as most customers generally want to take delivery on Dhanteras and Diwali. The pressure for delivery is not just in the bigger towns and cities, but even in smaller towns and rural.\"The surge in festive demand has placed significant constraints on availability of trailers. We are working to improve dispatches to our dealer network within the constraints,\" Nalinikanth Gollagunta, CEO, Automotive Division, M&M said.The same situation is being faced by Maruti which has seen a huge recovery in demand for small cars after the GST cut. \"We have pending deliveries of as many as 2.5 lakh vehicles, and most people prefer it around the Diwali period. We are working overtime and are now using railways to ensure that dispatches happen faster and on time,\" Partho Banerjee, senior executive officer (Marketing & Sales) at Maruti Suzuki, said.Amit Kamat, chief commercial officer at Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles, said the surge in demand for trailers and trucks began after Sept 22 as the new GST rates came into play. \"We expect this surge to be temporary and are closely working with our logistics partners to expedite dispatches... Despite logistical challenges, we remain fully committed and are working tirelessly to expedite deliveries to our dealerships in time for Diwali celebrations.\" Luxury players such as BMW are also feeling the pinch due to the sudden rush in demand. \"Customers like to take the delivery on auspicious days like Dhanteras and Diwali. This year, demand for deliveries on these specific days is much higher as pent-up demand from Aug-Sept is also coming into play... When the bottleneck suddenly opened, yes, there were certain logistics challenges in the start, but it is streamlined now,\" Hardeep Singh Brar, president and CEO of BMW Group India, said.In the two-wheeler industry, there is a similar challenge. Apart from logistics, companies are also plagued by the shortage of magnets. \"The cut in retail prices has meant that there has been a sudden rise in demand for scooters and motorcycles. However, the rare earth magnet issue is hampering production. The sudden rush in bookings is leading to pressure on deliveries,\" a top official of a leading company said, requesting anonymity.",

      "title": "Auto cos in a bind as customers scramble for festive deliveries amid logistics crunch - The Times of India",
      "body": "NEW DELHI: The festive rush is there but car and two-wheeler companies, flush with orders post the price cuts after the GST reduction, are now facing a unique problem - 'on time delivery' of vehicles during the festivals.While customers are seeking delivery during the auspicious period of Dhanteras and around Diwali, companies are increasingly finding it challenging to do so due to shortage of trucks and trailers. The shortage of rare earth magnets, which happens despite initial assurances around normalisation of supplies from China, is also delaying production, particularly of electrics and two-wheelers.Industry officials told TOI that the sudden rush in demand for deliveries - across industries such as automobiles, FMCG, ecommerce, fashion and lifestyle - has put a huge pressure on the trucking industry with trucking fleets working round-the-clock to deliver across the length and breadth of the country. \"Add to this the usual gifting rush around Diwali and you have a problem that is increasingly becoming very challenging to solve,\" an industry official said.The pressure on the auto companies is telling as most customers generally want to take delivery on Dhanteras and Diwali. The pressure for delivery is not just in the bigger towns and cities, but even in smaller towns and rural.\"The surge in festive demand has placed significant constraints on availability of trailers. We are working to improve dispatches to our dealer network within the constraints,\" Nalinikanth Gollagunta, CEO, Automotive Division, M&M said.The same situation is being faced by Maruti which has seen a huge recovery in demand for small cars after the GST cut. \"We have pending deliveries of as many as 2.5 lakh vehicles, and most people prefer it around the Diwali period. We are working overtime and are now using railways to ensure that dispatches happen faster and on time,\" Partho Banerjee, senior executive officer (Marketing & Sales) at Maruti Suzuki, said.Amit Kamat, chief commercial officer at Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles, said the surge in demand for trailers and trucks began after Sept 22 as the new GST rates came into play. \"We expect this surge to be temporary and are closely working with our logistics partners to expedite dispatches... Despite logistical challenges, we remain fully committed and are working tirelessly to expedite deliveries to our dealerships in time for Diwali celebrations.\" Luxury players such as BMW are also feeling the pinch due to the sudden rush in demand. \"Customers like to take the delivery on auspicious days like Dhanteras and Diwali. This year, demand for deliveries on these specific days is much higher as pent-up demand from Aug-Sept is also coming into play... When the bottleneck suddenly opened, yes, there were certain logistics challenges in the start, but it is streamlined now,\" Hardeep Singh Brar, president and CEO of BMW Group India, said.In the two-wheeler industry, there is a similar challenge. Apart from logistics, companies are also plagued by the shortage of magnets. \"The cut in retail prices has meant that there has been a sudden rise in demand for scooters and motorcycles. However, the rare earth magnet issue is hampering production. The sudden rush in bookings is leading to pressure on deliveries,\" a top official of a leading company said, requesting anonymity.",

    "Title": "Festive Stocking, Tax Relief & GST Cuts To Drive Auto Demand In H2FY26: Report",
    "Explanation": "New Delhi: The Indian automobile industry is heading into the second half of FY26 with cautious optimism, as festive stocking, reduction in GST rates, and income tax relief are expected to boost consumer demand, a report said on Friday. Meanwhile, September sales data reflected a mixed trend -- with strong growth in two-wheelers, three-wheelers, commercial vehicles, and tractors, even as passenger vehicle volumes slipped on a Year-on-Year (YoY) basis, Axis Securities highlighted.\n\nTwo Wheeler/Three Wheeler (2W/3W) Segment\n\nDomestic two-wheeler sales rose 6 per cent YoY and 18 per cent month-on-month (MoM), supported by strong performances from Royal Enfield (43 per cent YoY), Suzuki Motorcycle (37 per cent YoY), and TVS Motor (12 per cent YoY). Exports remained firm, rising 17 per cent YoY and 2 per cent MoM, led by Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp, RE, and TVS.\n\nThree-wheeler sales recorded 12 per cent YoY and 6 per cent MoM growth, largely driven by M&M (30 per cent YoY) and TVS (60 per cent YoY), the report noted.\n\nPassenger Vehicles (PV)\n\nThe PV segment saw a 5 per cent YoY decline in wholesales, though sales rebounded 16 per cent MoM, aided by deferred inventory clearance and GST reductions.\n\nJSW MG Motor and Tata Motors outperformed with 47 per cent and 45 per cent YoY growth, respectively, followed by Toyota Kirloskar (31 per cent YoY) and M&M (10 per cent YoY). Maruti Suzuki, however, slipped 6 per cent YoY, while Hyundai remained flat.\n\nCompany-wise, Tata Motors' PV sales jumped 45 per cent YoY, while M&M's PV division rose 10 per cent YoY. Maruti Suzuki reported a 6 per cent YoY drop in domestic sales, though MoM performance improved 2 per cent.\n\nTractors\n\nThe tractor industry witnessed a sharp rebound, with volumes up 50 per cent YoY and 124 per cent MoM, buoyed by good monsoons and high reservoir levels. M&amp;M's tractor sales surged 50 per cent YoY and 148 per cent MoM, Escorts Kubota rose 49 per cent YoY and 125 per cent MoM, while VST Tillers and Tractors posted a 42 per cent YoY gain but fell 27 per cent sequentially.\n\nCommercial Vehicles (CV)\n\nDomestic CV sales rose 11 per cent YoY and 19 per cent MoM. Tata Motors and M&M recorded mid-double-digit growth, while Ashok Leyland reported a 9 per cent YoY rise. Eicher Motors' VECV division remained flat YoY, but improved 6 per cent MoM. Maruti Suzuki's CV sales fell 7 per cent YoY.\n\nAxis security said that it remains cautiously optimistic for H2FY26, expecting high single-digit growth in PVs and steady demand in CVs, supported by festive demand, GST cuts, rural recovery, and new model launches.\n\nTractor sales are also expected to remain buoyant, aided by improved kharif harvest and reservoir conditions, the domestic brokerage firm said.",

    "Title": "Navratri 2025 delivers decade-high sales, GST cuts drive festive boom, claim govt sources - CNBC TV18",
    "Explanation": "India's consumer economy records its best Navratri sales in over 10 years, driven by GST rationalisation, increased spending on automobiles and electronics, and rising festive sentiment ahead of Diwali.India's consumer economy recorded its strongest Navratri sales in more than a decade, fuelled by the Modi government's NextGen GST reforms that reduced tax rates and lifted consumer sentiment. Lower prices across essential and aspirational items encouraged households to make big-ticket purchases, ranging from automobiles to consumer durables, delivering a sharp boost to the consumption-driven economy.\n\nGovernment sources said the rationalisation of GST slabs has unlocked household aspirations, enabling families to upgrade vehicles, invest in home appliances, and spend more freely on lifestyle goods during the festive season.\n\n\"These measures not only lowered prices but also unlocked consumer aspirations, enabling families to upgrade vehicles, invest in home appliances, and spend more freely on lifestyle goods, turning festive cheer into record-breaking consumption,\" government sources said.\n\nAuto sales at record highs\n\nThe automobile sector was among the biggest beneficiaries of the spending surge. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd posted its best Navratri performance in at least a decade, doubling sales from last year. The company reported 3.5 lakh bookings with nearly 2.5 lakh pending bookings. By the end of Navratri, Maruti is confident of touching the 2 lakh mark in deliveries. The company retailed 85,000 vehicles last Navratri.\n\nIn the first eight days of Navratri alone, Maruti delivered 1.65 lakh vehicles, including a record 30,000 cars on Day 1 -- the highest single-day delivery in its 35-year history.\n\nSUV demand remained strong across brands. Mahindra & Mahindra reported a 60% year-on-year jump in sales, led by models such as the XUV700 and Scorpio N. Hyundai Motor Indiasaid SUVs accounted for more than 72% of its sales, driven by the Creta and Venue. Tata Motors reported retailing over 50,000 vehicles during the festival season, powered by demand for the Altroz, Punch, Nexon and Tiago.\n\nTwo-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp said showroom footfalls doubled, particularly in the commuter segment, while Bajaj Auto also reported strong festival sales.\n\nConsumer electronics ride festive demand\n\nThe consumer durables segment also witnessed unprecedented momentum. Haier India reported an 85% increase in sales, nearly exhausting its Diwali stock of large-screen premium televisions.\n\nSales of 65-inch models averaged 300-350 units a day, while high-end 85-inch and 100-inch TVs priced above ₹2.5 lakh saw robust demand.\n\nReliance Retail, India's largest retailer, reported a 20-25% rise in sales over last Navratri, with categories such as smartphones, fashion, and large-screen TVs leading growth. Vijay Sales recorded more than 20% growth, while LG Electronics India cited \"exponential growth\" in sales across product categories. Godrej Appliances also reported strong double-digit growth.\n\nFestive economy outlook\n\nIndustry executives note that the first half of the festive season -- covering Onam, Durga Puja, and Dussehra -- accounts for 40-45% of India's overall festive sales.\n\nWith growth ranging from 25% to 100% across categories this Navratri, analysts say consumer sentiment has entered a new phase of optimism.\n\n\"The GST reforms have clearly reduced the tax burden on households and supported a more confident spending environment,\" a government source said. \"The festive season is now translating that sentiment into record sales across sectors.\"\n\n\"By rationalising GST slabs and easing the tax burden on both essential and aspirational items, the government fostered an environment of confident spending. As a result, brands and retailers reported sales growth ranging from 25% to 100%, marking a major boost for India's consumption-driven economy. Importantly, the first half of the festive season, spanning Onam, Durga Puja, and Dussehra accounts for 40-45% of total festive sales making it the largest consumption period in the country,\" government sources said.\n\nWith Diwali ahead, retailers and manufacturers are optimistic that the momentum will continue, setting the stage for one of the strongest festive quarters for the Indian economy in recent memory.",

    "Title": "Jaguar Land Rover Shows Cyberattacks Mean Business",
    "Explanation": "The month-long outage for luxury car maker Jaguar Land Rover appears to be at an end, with the company working through a \"controlled, phased restart\" of its manufacturing operations this week, following a massive cyberattack that forced the company to shut down its systems.\n\nJLR said on Sept. 2 that it had \"proactively\" shut down operations following a cyber incident, initially stating that customer data did not seem to be stolen, but revising that statement a week later. JLR, a subsidiary of Tata Motors, likely suffered $50 million to $70 million in lost revenue per week, with the total cost of the incident estimated at a staggering $1.7 billion to $2.4 billion.\n\nThe attack, and its vast impact, should be a warning for companies, says Chris Gibson, executive director of the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST).\n\nThe outage \"highlights that even large corporations with substantial resources can be completely disrupted and that critical industries may be more vulnerable than previously thought,\" he says. \"This was far beyond data theft, it was a complete operational outage.\"\n\nAutomakers have become a favored target of ransomware gangs, as compromising their IT systems can lead to operations outages and faster payment. Honda suffered an outage in 2017 as it struggled to deal with the widespread WannaCry attacks, and again in 2020, when the company took its manufacturing offline following a compromise. Overall, about half of the top-100 automobile manufacturers are highly susceptible to ransomware, a 2022 report concluded.\n\nYet, the makers of automobiles are not the only manufacturers in cybercriminals' sights. Third-party manufacturer Visser Precision -- which supplies parts to Tesla, SpaceX, and Boeing -- suffered a breach in 2020. The HELLCAT gang claimed to have stolen sensitive data from industrial control system (ICS) maker Schneider Electric in 2024. And in June, steelmaker Nucor acknowledged a breach of its systems dating back to May 2025, with limited impact on operations.\n\nOpportunity Costs of Failed Defenses\n\nA Telegram channel using the name \"Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters\" -- an amalgamation of three well-known groups: Scattered Spider, Lapsus$, and ShinyHunters -- claimed responsibility for the attack by showing a screenshot of JLR's internal systems, according to threat researchers. For its part, JLR has not released any details of its investigations, but the company is working with third parties.\n\n\"Today we are informing colleagues, retailers, and suppliers that some sections of our manufacturing operations will resume in the coming days,\" JLR said in a Sept. 29 statement. \"We continue to work around the clock alongside cybersecurity specialists, the UK government's NCSC and law enforcement to ensure our restart is done in a safe and secure manner.\"\n\nThe company has stopped manufacturing at multiple factories, which typically produce 1,000 vehicles a day, according to reports. While the manufacturing \"pause\" was initially to be short-lived, the company extended it to Oct. 1.\n\nThe IT systems outage at the end of August was not the first sign of trouble that the company had. In March, the HELLCAT ransomware group leaked 700 internal documents, purportedly part of a compromise of JLR's internal network using Jira credentials and also included development logs, source code, and a large employee dataset with usernames, email addresses, display names, and time zones, according to an analysis by threat intelligence firm Cyfirma.\n\nThe screenshot posted by the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunter group appears to show some development issues, and while the information leak may not have posed a risk on its own, the exposure of internal systems should have been concerning, the analysts stated.\n\n\"The targeting of operational systems, critical infrastructure, and connected vehicle modules suggests an interest in demonstrating control and influence, possibly to intimidate the company and its partners,\" Cyfirma stated in the analysis. \"While there is no direct evidence of ransom demands, the group could leverage the data for future exploitation or sell it, indicating potential financial incentives.\"\n\nThe Making of an Outage\n\nThe massive impact of the attack on JLR holds lessons, says FIRST's Gibson. The compromise was especially damaging because the company's systems were not appropriately segmented and attackers were able to impact both IT and OT systems. In addition, the attackers likely retained network access from the March compromises, enabling them to pick the worst time to cause an outage -- \"New Plate Day,\" one of the busiest sales days of the year.\n\n\"In short, JLR was targeted at a strategically vulnerable time, on a network that attackers already understood, which compounded the severity of the disruption,\" he says.\n\nManufacturers need to better their defenses and make their operations more resilient to cyberattacks, starting with strict segmentation of networks to limit lateral movement and use of multifactor authentication (MFA) to limit external access. Finally, even small security incidents should have thorough post-mortem remediation to ensure that attackers cannot maintain persistence.\n\n\"The JLR incident [shows] while prevention is critical, resilience determines the scale of impact,\" Gibson says. \"Manufacturers should focus on a key lesson, building systems that can withstand and recover from inevitable breaches.\"",

    "Explanation": "The demerger is a part of the firm's broader strategy to create focused verticals within the group each with independent governance and growth plans\n\nTata Motors (TML) on Friday said it has completed the demerger of its commercial vehicles (CV) business and the transfer of related group companies to TML Commercial Vehicles (TMLCV), as per the regulatory filings.\n\nThe development follows the sanction of the Composite Scheme of Arrangement by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Mumbai Bench, on August 25, 2025, with a subsequent rectification order on September 10, 2025.\n\nThe scheme, executed under Sections 230-232 of the Companies Act, 2013, enables the separation of the commercial vehicle and passenger vehicle businesses into distinct legal entities.\n\nPursuant to the scheme becoming effective, Tata Motors has transferred its entire shareholding in a wide range of direct and indirect subsidiaries, associates, and joint ventures to TMLCV.\n\nUnder the arrangement, Tata Motors' shareholding in several wholly-owned subsidiaries -- including Tata Motors Insurance Broking and Advisory Services, Tata Hispano Motors Carrocera, Tata Motors Body Solutions, TML CV Mobility Solutions, TMF Holdings, and TML Smart City Mobility Solutions -- now rests with TMLCV.\n\nThe demerger also includes indirect subsidiaries such as Tata Daewoo Mobility Company, PT Tata Motors Indonesia, TML CV Holdings, and TML CV Holdings, alongside their associated entities.\n\nIn addition, shareholdings in key associate companies -- including Automobile Corporation of Goa (49.77 per cent ), Tata Hitachi Construction Machinery Company (39.99 per cent ), and Freight Commerce Solutions (42.11 per cent on a fully diluted basis) -- have been transferred to TMLCV.\n\nJoint operations and ventures such as Tata Cummins, TCPL Green Energy Solutions, Tata Motors Digital.AI Labs, and Tata Motors Global Services are also part of the transfer.\n\nThe demerger is a part of Tata Motors' broader strategy to create focused verticals within the group -- commercial vehicles, passenger vehicles, and electric mobility -- each with independent governance and growth plans. The separation is expected to provide greater operational agility and enable each business to pursue its market-specific priorities.\n\nThe company has stated that all transfers are effective from the date of implementation of the scheme, and have been notified to stock exchanges, including BSE and NSE.",

    "Title": "Modi Govt's NextGen GST Reforms Propel India's Consumer Economy To Decade-High Navratri Sales",
    "Explanation": "India's consumer economy achieved its highest Navratri sales in over a decade, driven by record consumption across the automobile and consumer electronics sectors. This unprecedented surge is attributed to the Narendra Modi government's NextGen GST reforms, which rationalised tax rates, lowered product prices, and significantly boosted consumer confidence and aspirations.\n\nThe tax relief has empowered families to spend more freely, leading to record-breaking upgrades in vehicles and home appliances.\n\nThe automotive industry experienced an unparalleled sales momentum, with several major manufacturers reporting their best-ever Navratri performance:\n\nMaruti Suzuki: Sales doubled from last year, marking the best-ever Navratri in at least a decade. The company delivered a massive batch of 1.65 lakh vehicles in the first eight days. On Day 1 of Navratri, Maruti delivered a record 30,000 cars, its best single-day performance in 35 years.

      "body": "India's consumer economy achieved its highest Navratri sales in over a decade, driven by record consumption across the automobile and consumer electronics sectors. This unprecedented surge is attributed to the Narendra Modi government's NextGen GST reforms, which rationalised tax rates, lowered product prices, and significantly boosted consumer confidence and aspirations.\n\nThe tax relief has empowered families to spend more freely, leading to record-breaking upgrades in vehicles and home appliances.\n\nThe automotive industry experienced an unparalleled sales momentum, with several major manufacturers reporting their best-ever Navratri performance:\n\nMaruti Suzuki: Sales doubled from last year, marking the best-ever Navratri in at least a decade. The company delivered a massive batch of 1.65 lakh vehicles in the first eight days. On Day 1 of Navratri, Maruti delivered a record 30,000 cars, its best single-day performance in 35 years. Total bookings stand at 3.5 lakh, with nearly 2.5 lakh pending deliveries.\n\nMahindra & Mahindra: Retails for its popular SUV models, including the XUV700 and Scorpio N, jumped by 60% year-on-year.\n\nHyundai: A surge in demand for the Creta and Venue pushed the share of SUVs in total sales to over 72%.\n\nTata Motors: The company retailed more than 50,000 vehicles, fueled by strong demand for models like the Altroz, Punch, Nexon, and Tiago.\n\nTwo-Wheelers: Hero MotoCorp reported that showroom footfalls doubled, with high traction noted in the crucial commuter segment.

    "Title": "GST cuts push Navratri sales to 10-year high : Government",
    "Explanation": "India's consumer economy achieved its highest Navratri sales in over a decade, driven by next-generation Goods and Service Tax (GST) reforms that lowered prices on hundreds of items.\n\nIndia's consumer economy witnessed its highest Navratri sales in over a decade, boosted by the next-generation Goods and Service Tax reforms that reduced tax rates and made products more affordable, government sources said.\n\nThese measures not only lowered prices but also unlocked consumer aspirations, enabling families to upgrade vehicles, invest in home appliances, and spend more freely on lifestyle goods, turning festive cheer into \"record-breaking\" consumption, the sources said.\n\nNavratri festival commenced on September 22, coinciding with GST cuts on hundreds of items, and ended on October 2.\n\nCar maker Maruti Suzuki's Navratri sales doubled from last year, the best-ever in at least a decade. The company reported 3,50,000 bookings with nearly 2,50,000 pending bookings. By end of this Navratri period, it was confident of touching the 2,00,000 mark in deliveries. The company retailed 85,000 vehicles last Navratri.\n\nAutomobile sector leads the record-breaking sales spree\n\nMaruti Suzuki delivered as much as 1,65,000 vehicles in the first eight days of Navratri. On Day 1 of Navratri, Maruti delivered a record 30,000 cars, its best single-day performance in 35 years. Mahindra & Mahindra, which sells popular SUVs such as the XUV700 and Scorpio N, saw retails jump 60% on-year. At Hyundai, the surge in demand for models like Creta and Venue pushed SUVs' share of total sales to over 72%.\n\nShowroom footfalls of two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp doubled this Navratri with high traction in the commuter segment. Tata motors retailed more than 50,000 vehicles during the festive period, with demand from Altroz, Punch, Nexon and Tiago models.Bajaj Auto also reported strong sales during Navratri.\n\nElectronics and retail mirror auto sector's high growth\n\nSimilarly, in the consumer electronics space, LG, Haier, and Godrej Appliances reported high double-digit sales growth this Navratri compared to last year, the sources said. Haier's sales soared 85%, nearly selling out its Diwali stock of 85-inch and 100-inch TVs priced above Rs 2.5 lakh. The company also sold 300-350 units of 65-inch TVs daily during the period. Sales at India's largest retailer Reliance Retail grew by 20-25% over last year's Navratri with categories like large-screen TVs, smartphones, and fashion driving the sales momentum. Electronics retail chain Vijay Sales too saw a more than 20% sales growth.\n\nLG Electronics India also noted \"exponential growth\" in sales this Navratri season. Brands and retailers reported sales growth ranging from 25% to 100%, marking a major boost for India's consumption-driven economy, the sources added.\n\nThe first half of the festive season, spanning Onam, Durga Puja, and Dussehra accounts for 40-45% of total festive sales making it the largest consumption period in the country.",

    "Title": "India logs highest Navratri sales in a decade as GST cuts fuel record festive demand",
    "Explanation": "Automobile and consumer electronics makers report sales growth of 25-100% during Navratri, with Maruti Suzuki and Haier leading the surge, government sources said.\n\nIndia's consumer economy has clocked its highest Navratri sales in over 10 years, boosted by the Modi government's NextGen GST reforms that lowered tax rates and made products more accessible, according to government sources.\n\nThe rationalisation of GST slabs eased the tax burden across essential and aspirational items, spurring confident spending. Families upgraded cars, home appliances and lifestyle goods, driving a surge in demand that brands described as record-breaking.\n\nAutomobile sector: Maruti sets historic benchmark\n\nAutomakers were among the biggest winners this Navratri.\n\nMaruti Suzuki reported its best-ever Navratri performance in at least a decade, with sales doubling year-on-year. The company secured 150,000 bookings and expects to touch 200,000 bookings, compared to 85,000 vehicles retailed last Navratri. It delivered 1.65 lakh vehicles in the first eight days of the festival, including a record 30,000 cars on Day 1 alone, marking the company's best single-day performance in 35 years, government sources said.\n\nMahindra & Mahindra, which sells popular SUVs like the XUV700 and Scorpio N, posted a 60 percent jump in retails year-on-year.\n\nAt Hyundai, strong demand for Creta and Venue pushed SUVs to over 72 percent of total sales, government sources added.\n\nHero MotoCorp saw showroom footfalls double this Navratri, with particularly strong traction in the commuter two-wheeler segment.\n\nTata Motors retailed more than 50,000 vehicles, led by Altroz, Punch, Nexon and Tiago models.\n\nBajaj Auto also reported robust festive sales, according to government sources.\n\nConsumer electronics: Haier, LG and Reliance lead surge\n\nThe electronics segment also saw booming demand, with brands posting high double-digit growth.\n\nHaier's sales soared 85%, nearly exhausting its Diwali stock of 85-inch and 100-inch TVs priced above Rs 2.5 lakh. The company sold 300-350 units of 65-inch TVs daily during Navratri.\n\nLG Electronics India reported \"exponential growth\" across its product lines.\n\nReliance Retail, India's largest retailer, saw 20-25 percent growth year-on-year, with large-screen TVs, smartphones and fashion categories leading sales momentum, government sources said.\n\nElectronics retailer Vijay Sales reported more than 20 percent growth in sales.\n\nGodrej Appliances also saw high double-digit growth this Navratri.\n\nFestive economy outlook\n\nWith brands and retailers reporting sales growth between 25 percent and 100 percent, the first half of India's festive season, spanning Onam, Durga Puja and Dussehra, has emerged as the largest consumption window of the year, accounting for 40-45 percent of total festive sales, according to government sources.\n\nThe record-breaking Navratri demand underscores how GST cuts have translated into higher affordability and stronger consumer sentiment, giving India's consumption-driven economy a powerful festive boost.",

    "Title": "Jaguar Land Rover on state life support after cyberattack",
    "Explanation": "Why is the state taking action? Because the risk is systemic. JLR, owned by India's Tata Motors, has 34,000 direct employees, 120,000 more in the supply chain, and nearly one in three vehicles assembled in the UK last year -- just behind Nissan. When such a major player shuts down for a month, the disruption spreads like wildfire: behind the tier 1 suppliers are tiers 2, 3, and 4 with tiny cash reserves, which also supply other manufacturers. The cyberattack forced the group to shut down its systems and production. The cost of this shutdown amounts to £50m (€57.2m) per week in lost production, according to the BBC.\n\nHence the urgent need for a financial bridge. In concrete terms, JLR is finalizing a loan from HSBC, MUFG, and NatWest, backed by the UKEF guarantee. At the same time, the group has already secured a £2bn credit line from Standard Chartered Bank, Citigroup, and MUFG. The goal is to replenish working capital, pay in advance for components usually purchased on credit, and restart the pump.\n\nWhat we know -- and don't know -- about the attack. On September 2, JLR shut down its IT systems and acknowledged a \"cyber incident.\" Since then, neither the company nor its parent company has provided any technical details: entry point, malware, exfiltration? Radio silence. All that remains are strange claims and rumors published online. On Telegram, a group calling itself Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters published screenshots in early September that they claimed were from JLR's internal systems.\n\nAt KELA's Cyber Intelligence Center, caution is the order of the day: as long as no victims confirm the claims and no databases have been exfiltrated and exposed, the default position remains skepticism. Why are these aliases causing such a stir? Because they are playing with very real ghosts. Lapsus$, now silent, has made some resounding hits: Uber (2022), Rockstar Games (2023). Their signature? Total control of networks, deployment of ransomware, organized paralysis... and a bill in bitcoins. Their entry point? Social engineering, the art of tricking an employee over the phone, by email, or by text message, until they get the key that unlocks the infrastructure. Their profile?\n\nLet's return to JLR with one certainty that has emerged: the manufacturer did not have cyber insurance at the time of the incident. This has fueled criticism of digital risk preparedness and management, as the economic cost continues to rise.\n\nIn financial terms, the mechanics of the guarantee are well known. UKEF does not lend money: the public agency grants banks a partial guarantee -- up to 80% of the risk -- on cash or investment loans granted to a major exporter. Taxpayers are only exposed in the event of default, a risk that analysts consider \"unlikely.\" In exchange, UKEF charges a risk premium, which is included in the interest rate paid by the borrower. The precise terms remain confidential, as is always the case with these matters.

      "title": "Jaguar Land Rover on state life support after cyberattack",
      "body": "Why is the state taking action? Because the risk is systemic. JLR, owned by India's Tata Motors, has 34,000 direct employees, 120,000 more in the supply chain, and nearly one in three vehicles assembled in the UK last year -- just behind Nissan. When such a major player shuts down for a month, the disruption spreads like wildfire: behind the tier 1 suppliers are tiers 2, 3, and 4 with tiny cash reserves, which also supply other manufacturers. The cyberattack forced the group to shut down its systems and production. The cost of this shutdown amounts to £50m (€57.2m) per week in lost production, according to the BBC.\n\nHence the urgent need for a financial bridge. In concrete terms, JLR is finalizing a loan from HSBC, MUFG, and NatWest, backed by the UKEF guarantee. At the same time, the group has already secured a £2bn credit line from Standard Chartered Bank, Citigroup, and MUFG. The goal is to replenish working capital, pay in advance for components usually purchased on credit, and restart the pump.\n\nWhat we know -- and don't know -- about the attack. On September 2, JLR shut down its IT systems and acknowledged a \"cyber incident.\" Since then, neither the company nor its parent company has provided any technical details: entry point, malware, exfiltration? Radio silence. All that remains are strange claims and rumors published online. On Telegram, a group calling itself Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters published screenshots in early September that they claimed were from JLR's internal systems.\n\nAt KELA's Cyber Intelligence Center, caution is the order of the day: as long as no victims confirm the claims and no databases have been exfiltrated and exposed, the default position remains skepticism. Why are these aliases causing such a stir? Because they are playing with very real ghosts. Lapsus$, now silent, has made some resounding hits: Uber (2022), Rockstar Games (2023). Their signature? Total control of networks, deployment of ransomware, organized paralysis... and a bill in bitcoins. Their entry point? Social engineering, the art of tricking an employee over the phone, by email, or by text message, until they get the key that unlocks the infrastructure. Their profile?\n\nLet's return to JLR with one certainty that has emerged: the manufacturer did not have cyber insurance at the time of the incident. This has fueled criticism of digital risk preparedness and management, as the economic cost continues to rise.\n\nIn financial terms, the mechanics of the guarantee are well known. UKEF does not lend money: the public agency grants banks a partial guarantee -- up to 80% of the risk -- on cash or investment loans granted to a major exporter. Taxpayers are only exposed in the event of default, a risk that analysts consider \"unlikely.\" In exchange, UKEF charges a risk premium, which is included in the interest rate paid by the borrower. The precise terms remain confidential, as is always the case with these matters. This is not the UK's first attempt: in July, Ford obtained an £800m UKEF guarantee on a £1bn loan for its transition to electric vehicles; meanwhile, SeAH Wind UK received £590m for an offshore wind farm in Teesside in 2023-24. The logic of strategic interest: where banks hesitate, the state steps in.\n\nHowever, the operation is not without controversy. Economists are waving the flag of \"moral hazard\": if the public backstop becomes predictable, other companies could decide not to insure themselves against cyber risks or take a more lax approach to risk management, counting on a bailout.\n\nWhat now?

    "Title": "Tata Motors Sells Record 60,907 Cars In September - EV & CNG Sales Double",
    "Explanation": "Tata Motors set a new benchmark in September 2025, reporting its highest-ever monthly passenger vehicle sales. Tata Motors sold 60,907 passenger vehicles last month, including 59,667 units in the domestic market, registering a massive 45.3 per cent year-on-year increase.\n\nExports played a role in this record as well, with 1,240 units shipped overseas compared to just 250 units in the same month last year. That surge reflects a 396 per cent rise and underlines Tata's growing presence in international markets.\n\nTogether, green fuel models (EV + CNG) made up 44 per cent of Tata's overall sales in the quarter. This aligns with the company's broader strategy of offering multiple sustainable powertrain options across its lineup.\n\nIn model-wise performance, the Nexon emerged as the leader with over 22,500 units sold in September - its best-ever single month. Meanwhile, the Harrier and Safari achieved their strongest combined sales, helped by the introduction of the new Adventure X edition.\n\nThe industry-wide GST 2.0 rollout and the festive season provided a clear boost. New tax structures brought down effective prices in some categories, encouraging faster decision-making among buyers and lifting footfalls in showrooms nationwide.\n\nTata Motors Sales - September 2025\n\nShailesh Chandra, Managing Director, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles said,\n\n\"The passenger vehicles industry marked a sharp upswing in demand during September 2025 following the rollout of GST 2.0, further buoyed by festive tailwinds. This surge in demand sets a promising tone for sustained growth in the months ahead. September 2025 emerged as a watershed month with sales of 60,907 units (domestic wholesales of 59,667 units), our highest ever, marking a substantial 47% year-on-year growth. EV sales surged 96%+ while CNG sales reached an all-time high of over 17,800 units.\"\n\nThe momentum was visible in the quarter results, too. Tata's Q2 FY26 PV sales stood at 144,397 units, up 10.4 per cent year-on-year. Domestic numbers hit 140,189 units, while exports climbed to 4,208 units with 411 per cent growth.\n\nThis record surge also altered market rankings. Tata Motors has now climbed to second spot in India's auto market, overtaking Hyundai and Mahindra.",

    "Explanation": "Tata Motors' strong SUV and EV sales helped it reclaim the No. 2 spot in India's passenger vehicle market, with September registrations rising 28%, while overall EV adoption more than doubled, highlighting the company's growing dominance in the electric mobility segment.\n\nTata Motors shares are set to be in the spotlight on Friday, October 3, after reclaiming the No. 2 position in India's passenger vehicle (PV) market by overtaking Hyundai Motor India and Mahindra & Mahindra in September registrations.\n\nThe company's strong showing was powered by robust sales of its SUVs and electric vehicles. Further, Tata Motors also widened its lead over JSW MG Motor in the electric vehicle segment, according to data from the government's Vahan portal.\n\nMaruti Suzuki continues to hold the top position.\n\nTata Motors recorded 40,594 PV registrations in September, including EVs, marking a 28 per cent rise from 31,581 units a year ago. Hyundai, which held the No. 2 spot last year, slipped to fourth with 35,443 registrations (down from 37,666), while Mahindra stood at third with 37,015 units.\n\nMarket leader Maruti Suzuki registered 122,278 units, up from 113,560 last year.\n\nTata's ascent was driven by models like the Nexon, Punch, and Harrier in the internal combustion segment, alongside strong demand for its electric offerings, Nexon EV, Tiago EV, and Punch EV, which contributed an estimated 13-15 per cent of total volumes.\n\nOverall EV registrations more than doubled year-on-year to 15,040 units in September, from 6,210 units last year.\n\nNew players like Tesla and Vinfast also joined the fray, recording 60 and six units respectively. Tata Motors retained a dominant position with an estimated 70 per cent share of the mass EV market, significantly ahead of MG's EV volumes.\n\nWhile Hyundai's slide reflects slower growth in models like the Creta and Venue and limited traction in its premium EVs such as Ioniq 5, Mahindra maintained third place with its SUV lineup (Scorpio-N, Bolero, XUV700, and Thar), though it is yet to make a significant entry into the mass EV segment.\n\nThe September numbers were influenced by seasonal factors such as the early onset of Navratri (September 22-October 2), the Shraddh period, and recent GST cuts on small cars, which bunched up registrations toward the end of the month. Still, Tata Motors' resurgence in both the PV and EV space marks a significant development that could keep investor focus on the stock heading into the weekend.",

    "Title": "Navratri sales hit decade high, GST reforms drive festive consumption surge - The Statesman",
    "Explanation": "Festive buying surged across categories, from cars and two-wheelers to large-screen televisions and smartphones, turning Navratri into one of the most profitable sales periods in recent years.\n\nIndia's consumer economy recorded its strongest Navratri sales in more than a decade, with automobile and electronics companies reporting sharp double-digit growth.\n\nFestive buying surged across categories, from cars and two-wheelers to large-screen televisions and smartphones, turning Navratri into one of the most profitable sales periods in recent years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndustry executives attributed the buoyant demand to the Modi government's NextGen GST reforms, which lowered tax rates, reduced prices, and expanded access to aspirational goods.\n\nAccording to the data, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd led the charge, posting its best Navratri performance in at least 10 years. Sales doubled year-on-year, with the company securing 150,000 bookings so far and expecting to touch 200,000. It delivered 1.65 lakh vehicles in the first eight days, including a record 30,000 cars on the first day alone, the highest single-day tally in the company's 35-year history.\n\nRival Mahindra & Mahindra saw retail sales climb 60% year-on-year, driven by SUVs such as the XUV700 and Scorpio N. Hyundai Motor India reported that demand for the Creta and Venue pushed SUVs' share of its sales to over 72%.\n\nTwo-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp said showroom footfalls doubled this Navratri, with commuter models seeing high traction. Tata Motors retailed more than 50,000 vehicles during the festive week, powered by demand for the Altroz, Punch, Nexon and Tiago. Bajaj Auto also reported strong sales momentum.\n\nThe consumer electronics market mirrored the auto sector's festive highs. Haier India reported an 85% jump in sales, nearly exhausting its Diwali stock of premium 85-inch and 100-inch televisions priced above Rs 2.5 lakh. The company sold 300-350 units of 65-inch TVs daily during Navratri.\n\nReliance Retail, India's largest retailer, posted 20-25% growth led by large-screen TVs, smartphones and fashion. Vijay Sales also reported over 20% growth, while LG Electronics India and Godrej Appliances said they witnessed strong double-digit expansion.\n\nAccording to analysts, rationalisation of GST slabs and easing of tax burdens on both essential and aspirational items have unlocked consumer confidence, boosting discretionary spending. Overall, retailers and manufacturers reported sales growth ranging from 25% to 100% compared to last year.\n\nThe first half of the festive season, covering Onam, Durga Puja, and Dussehra, accounts for 40-45% of total festive sales, making it the largest consumption period in the country. This year's record-breaking Navratri performance signals robust momentum heading into Diwali.",

    "Explanation": "It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that the Tata Nexon EV has been one of the key drivers in popularising electric cars in India. Over the years, Tata Motors has continuously refined the Nexon EV, making it not only one of the most successful EVs in the country but also the best-selling model since its debut. In its latest update, the brand introduced a new top-spec version with a larger 45 kWh battery pack. With this update, the 40 kWh variant has been discontinued, although the 30 kWh entry-level option remains available. Naturally, when it comes to EVs, the most important question buyers ask is: \"How far will it go on a single charge?\" To find out, we took the Nexon EV 45 out for a real-world range test.\n\nIn our test, the Nexon EV 45 managed to deliver around 330 km on a single charge. Of course, this figure can vary based on driving style and conditions -- going downhill or driving more gently can stretch the range further, while uphill climbs or a heavy right foot will bring it down.\n\nOn paper, Tata Motors claims an MIDC range of 489 km, while the C75 rating sits between 350 and 375 km. To keep things consistent, we drove the SUV in Eco mode, using regen level 2 in city traffic and level 1 on the highways -- since the highest setting (level 3) feels too aggressive, and coasting works better on open stretches. Comfort features like air-conditioning (set at 24°C, fan speed 2-3) and the driver's ventilated seat were kept on throughout the drive.\n\nOne of the highlights of the Nexon EV 45 is its suspension setup. It does a commendable job of ironing out potholes and uneven surfaces, making city driving quite comfortable. That said, the weight of the large battery pack is noticeable, especially at higher speeds where you feel some body roll and lateral movement on long straights. This is where something like an MG Windsor EV Pro feels more confident and stable.\n\n(Also read: Living with the Tata Nexon EV for over 1,000 km. Here's what we learned)\n\nThe panoramic sunroof -- exclusive to the 45 kWh variant -- adds to the premium feel, and the inclusion of a small frunk under the hood is a practical touch for extra storage. There is also window sunshades available for the rear occupants. During our test, we did encounter a minor glitch with the instrument cluster, where the display information overlapped and became cluttered, something Tata will hopefully iron out in future updates.",

    "Explanation": "At Hyundai, demand for the Creta and Venue pushed SUVs' share of total sales to over 72 per cent.\n\nShowQuick Read\n\nSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed\n\n* India's Navratri sales reached a decade high due to GST reforms lowering tax rates and prices\n\n* Maruti Suzuki doubled Navratri sales with 1.65 lakh vehicles delivered in eight days\n\n* Consumer electronics sales grew significantly, with Haier's sales up by 85%\n\nDid our AI summary help?\n\nLet us know.\n\nSwitch To Beeps Mode\n\nIndia's consumer economy has achieved its highest Navratri sales in over a decade, a surge attributed to the Modi government's NextGen GST reforms, which reduced tax rates and increased product accessibility. These measures lowered prices and unlocked consumer spending, leading to upgrades of vehicles, investments in home appliances, and increased spending on lifestyle goods.\n\nBrands and retailers across sectors reported significant sales growth, generally ranging from 25 per cent to 100 per cent. The festive season's first half, including Onam, Durga Puja, and Dussehra, is the country's largest consumption period, accounting for 40-45 per cent of total festive sales.\n\nAutomobile Sector Drives Growth\n\nThe automobile sector experienced a remarkable festive season: Maruti Suzuki's Navratri sales doubled from last year, marking its best performance in at least a decade. The car maker delivered a massive batch of 1.65 lakh vehicles in the first eight days of Navratri. On Day 1, Maruti delivered a record 30,000 cars, its best single-day performance in 35 years. The company reported 1,50,000 bookings and anticipates reaching 2,00,000 bookings, compared to 85,000 vehicles retailed last Navratri.\n\nMahindra & Mahindra recorded a 60 per cent year-on-year jump in retail sales for its popular SUVs, including the XUV700 and Scorpio N.\n\nTata Motors retailed over 50,000 vehicles, driven by demand for models such as the Altroz, Punch, Nexon and Tiago.\n\nAt Hyundai, demand for the Creta and Venue pushed SUVs' share of total sales to over 72 per cent.\n\nShowroom footfall for two-wheeler manufacturer Hero MotoCorp doubled this Navratri, with high traction in the commuter segment.\n\nBajaj Auto also reported strong sales during the period.\n\nBoom in Consumer Electronics\n\nThe consumer electronics sector saw significant high, double-digit sales growth compared to last year.\n\nHaier's sales soared by 85 per cent.\n\nThe company nearly sold out its Diwali stock of 85-inch and 100-inch TVs, priced above Rs 2.5 lakh, and sold 300-350 units of 65-inch TVs daily.\n\nSales at India's largest retailer, Reliance Retail, grew by 20-25 per cent over last year's Navratri, with sales momentum driven by large-screen TVs, smartphones and fashion.\n\nElectronics retail chain Vijay Sales saw sales growth of more than 20 per cent. LG Electronics India also noted \"exponential growth\" in sales this Navratri season.\n\nThe rationalisation of GST slabs and the easing of the tax burden on both essential and aspirational items fostered an environment of confident spending.\n\nShow full article\n\nTrack Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India and around the world\n\nGst Cut, GST Cut Car Prices, GST Cut In Auto Sector",

    "Explanation": "\"We remain cautiously optimistic for H2FY26\" - Axis Securities Report\n\nMeanwhile, September sales data reflected a mixed trend -- with strong growth in two-wheelers, three-wheelers, commercial vehicles, and tractors, even as passenger vehicle volumes slipped on a Year-on-Year (YoY) basis, Axis Securities highlighted.\n\nTwo Wheeler/Three Wheeler (2W/3W) Segment: Domestic two-wheeler sales rose 6 per cent YoY and 18 per cent month-on-month (MoM), supported by strong performances from Royal Enfield (43 per cent YoY), Suzuki Motorcycle (37 per cent YoY), and TVS Motor (12 per cent YoY).\n\nExports remained firm, rising 17 per cent YoY and 2 per cent MoM, led by Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp, RE, and TVS.\n\nThree-wheeler sales recorded 12 per cent YoY and 6 per cent MoM growth, largely driven by M&M (30 per cent YoY) and TVS (60 per cent YoY), the report noted.\n\nPassenger Vehicles (PV): The PV segment saw a 5 per cent YoY decline in wholesales, though sales rebounded 16 per cent MoM, aided by deferred inventory clearance and GST reductions.\n\nJSW MG Motor and Tata Motors outperformed with 47 per cent and 45 per cent YoY growth, respectively, followed by Toyota Kirloskar (31 per cent YoY) and M&M (10 per cent YoY). Maruti Suzuki, however, slipped 6 per cent YoY, while Hyundai remained flat.\n\nCompany-wise, Tata Motors' PV sales jumped 45 per cent YoY, while M&M's PV division rose 10 per cent YoY. Maruti Suzuki reported a 6 per cent YoY drop in domestic sales, though MoM performance improved 2 per cent.\n\nTractors: The tractor industry witnessed a sharp rebound, with volumes up 50 per cent YoY and 124 per cent MoM, buoyed by good monsoons and high reservoir levels. M&M's tractor sales surged 50 per cent YoY and 148 per cent MoM, Escorts Kubota rose 49 per cent YoY and 125 per cent MoM, while VST Tillers and Tractors posted a 42 per cent YoY gain but fell 27 per cent sequentially.\n\nCommercial Vehicles (CV): Domestic CV sales rose 11 per cent YoY and 19 per cent MoM. Tata Motors and M&M recorded mid-double-digit growth, while Ashok Leyland reported a 9 per cent YoY rise. Eicher Motors' VECV division remained flat YoY, but improved 6 per cent MoM. Maruti Suzuki's CV sales fell 7 per cent YoY.\n\nAxis security said that it remains cautiously optimistic for H2FY26, expecting high single-digit growth in PVs and steady demand in CVs, supported by festive demand, GST cuts, rural recovery, and new model launches.\n\nTractor sales are also expected to remain buoyant, aided by improved kharif harvest and reservoir conditions, the domestic brokerage firm said.",

    "Title": "Festive stocking, tax relief and GST cuts to drive auto demand in H2FY26; September sales show mixed trend",
    "Explanation": "New Delhi, Oct 3 (SocialNews.XYZ) The Indian automobile industry is heading into the second half of FY26 with cautious optimism, as festive stocking, reduction in GST rates, and income tax relief are expected to boost consumer demand, a report said on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, September sales data reflected a mixed trend -- with strong growth in two-wheelers, three-wheelers, commercial vehicles, and tractors, even as passenger vehicle volumes slipped on a Year-on-Year (YoY) basis, Axis Securities highlighted.\n\nTwo Wheeler/Three Wheeler (2W/3W) Segment: Domestic two-wheeler sales rose 6 per cent YoY and 18 per cent month-on-month (MoM), supported by strong performances from Royal Enfield (43 per cent YoY), Suzuki Motorcycle (37 per cent YoY), and TVS Motor (12 per cent YoY).\n\nExports remained firm, rising 17 per cent YoY and 2 per cent MoM, led by Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp, RE, and TVS.\n\nThree-wheeler sales recorded 12 per cent YoY and 6 per cent MoM growth, largely driven by M&M (30 per cent YoY) and TVS (60 per cent YoY), the report noted.\n\nPassenger Vehicles (PV): The PV segment saw a 5 per cent YoY decline in wholesales, though sales rebounded 16 per cent MoM, aided by deferred inventory clearance and GST reductions.\n\nJSW MG Motor and Tata Motors outperformed with 47 per cent and 45 per cent YoY growth, respectively, followed by Toyota Kirloskar (31 per cent YoY) and M&M (10 per cent YoY). Maruti Suzuki, however, slipped 6 per cent YoY, while Hyundai remained flat.\n\nCompany-wise, Tata Motors' PV sales jumped 45 per cent YoY, while M&M's PV division rose 10 per cent YoY. Maruti Suzuki reported a 6 per cent YoY drop in domestic sales, though MoM performance improved 2 per cent.\n\nTractors: The tractor industry witnessed a sharp rebound, with volumes up 50 per cent YoY and 124 per cent MoM, buoyed by good monsoons and high reservoir levels. M&M's tractor sales surged 50 per cent YoY and 148 per cent MoM, Escorts Kubota rose 49 per cent YoY and 125 per cent MoM, while VST Tillers and Tractors posted a 42 per cent YoY gain but fell 27 per cent sequentially.\n\nCommercial Vehicles (CV): Domestic CV sales rose 11 per cent YoY and 19 per cent MoM. Tata Motors and M&M recorded mid-double-digit growth, while Ashok Leyland reported a 9 per cent YoY rise. Eicher Motors' VECV division remained flat YoY, but improved 6 per cent MoM. Maruti Suzuki's CV sales fell 7 per cent YoY.\n\nAxis security said that it remains cautiously optimistic for H2FY26, expecting high single-digit growth in PVs and steady demand in CVs, supported by festive demand, GST cuts, rural recovery, and new model launches.\n\nTractor sales are also expected to remain buoyant, aided by improved kharif harvest and reservoir conditions, the domestic brokerage firm said.",

    "Title": "Business News | Jehangir Hospital: Pune's Most Advanced Robotic Orthopaedic Surgery Clinic | LatestLY",
    "Explanation": "Pune (Maharashtra) [India], October 3: For over 80 years, Jehangir Hospital has been Pune's trusted name in healthcare, known for excellence and compassionate care. Continuing this legacy, the hospital introduces the city's most advanced joint replacement solution -- the Advanced Robotic Orthopaedic Surgery Clinic, powered by the globally acclaimed MAKO Robotic-Arm Assisted System. This breakthrough combines robotic precision with the expertise of certified orthopaedic surgeons, delivering safer, more accurate, and personalised surgeries that restore mobility and enhance quality of life -- faster than ever.\n\nAlso Read | Tata Motors Demerger: Automaker Announces Record Date for Demerger of Its Commercial Vehicles Business on October 14.\n\nThe Scope - More Than Just Joint Replacement:\n\nMore than just conventional procedures, this clinic is a comprehensive hub for complex, life-changing orthopaedic care, powered by the MAKO Robotic-Arm Assisted System and expert surgeons.\n\nAlso Read | Bihar CM Nitish Kumar Transfers INR 10,000 Each to 25 Lakh Women Under Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana (See Pics).\n\nOur expertise covers the full spectrum of advanced joint care. From Total Knee Replacements (TKR) that ensure perfect alignment and longer implant life in advanced arthritis, to Partial Knee Replacements that preserve healthy bone and tissue when only part of the knee is affected. We also offer Total Hip Replacements (THR) with micrometre precision for pain-free mobility, along with complex hip reconstructions and replacements designed for deformities, failed surgeries, or severe joint damage. In addition, our advanced robotic procedures include revision surgeries, deformity corrections, joint preservation techniques, and treatment of failed or infected implants -- all performed with unmatched precision and safety.\n\nSurgery is just the first step. Our dedicated physiotherapy team delivers customised programmes to restore strength, flexibility, and independence. From gait training to joint functionality, every detail is designed to speed recovery, optimise fitness, and extend implant longevity.\n\nHow Robotic Surgery Works - Precision You Can Trust:\n\nThe process begins with a high-resolution CT scan, creating a 3D model of the joint and enabling surgeons to plan every detail in advance. During surgery, the MAKO system's AccuStop™ haptic guidance acts as a safeguard, keeping instruments within pre-set safe zones. This protects healthy bone and tissue while allowing implant placement with millimetre-level precision -- accuracy beyond the reach of the human hand alone.\n\nWhile the MAKO system delivers unmatched precision, it is guided by the expertise and empathy of Jehangir Hospital's Certified Robotic Surgeons -- Dr. Rahul Damle, Dr. Aashish Arbat, Dr. Suresh Patil, Dr. Yogesh Jain, Dr. Anshu Sachdev, and Dr. Kunal Bansal. Trained in advanced orthopaedic techniques and internationally certified in robotic-assisted surgery, they blend deep anatomical knowledge, surgical skill, and compassionate care with cutting-edge robotics -- ensuring every procedure is not only clinically precise, but also truly personalised.\n\nSurgeons' Perspectives:\n\nDr. Rahul Damle, Senior Consultant Orthopaedic and Certified Robotic Joint Replacement Surgeon, explains: \"This programme is a milestone in our mission to bring world-class orthopaedic solutions to Pune. It gives us unprecedented precision and control, enabling us to deliver joint replacements that are not only accurate but also tailored for each patient. This means better joint function, quicker recovery, and an improved quality of life.\"\n\nDr. Aashish Arbat, Senior Consultant Orthopaedic and Certified Robotic Joint Replacement Surgeon says: \"The MAKO robotic system at Jehangir Hospital allows me to offer my patients a level of precision and personalization that was not possible with conventional techniques. As a trained and MAKO-certified surgeon, I have seen how this technology enhances surgical accuracy, ensures optimal implant placement, and speeds up recovery. My focus is always on delivering personalised surgical experience with exceptional outcomes, and with MAKO, I can confidently provide patients with safer, more reliable, and long-lasting joint replacements.\"\n\nDr. Suresh Patil, Senior Consultant Orthopaedic and American Board (ABPS) Certified Robotic Joint Replacement Surgeon explains: \"This advancement supports safer procedures, more natural movement, less implant wear, and longer-lasting results for patients. It is now used across joint replacement procedures -- including robotic joint replacements, hip replacement through the direct anterior (muscle-sparing) approach, minimally invasive knee and hip replacements, and revision surgeries for previously unsuccessful procedures. I see this as an important milestone in orthopaedic technology -- helping people regain comfort, mobility, and confidence.\"\n\nDr. Yogesh Jain, Senior Consultant Orthopaedic and Certified Robotic Joint Replacement Surgeon says: \"With robotic assistance, we can customise every aspect of the surgery to the patient's needs. This precision allows us to restore function more effectively and help patients regain their active lifestyle sooner.\"\n\nDr. Anshu Sachdev, Senior Consultant Orthopaedic and Certified Robotic Joint Replacement Surgeon explains: \"With the MAKO system, we can see and plan every detail of the surgery with unmatched clarity. This advanced technology that encompasses unparalleled visualisation and precision, combined with surgical expertise, helps us perform even complex joint reconstructions with accuracy and confidence. For patients, it means a procedure that's personalised to their needs -- leading to quicker recovery, greater comfort, and results that last.\"\n\nDr Kunal Bansal, Senior Consultant Orthopaedic and Certified Robotic Joint Replacement Surgeon explains: \"Robotic joint replacement is transforming the way we care for patients. The technology gives me a precise, real-time 3D map of your unique anatomy, ensuring implants are placed with unparalleled accuracy. This means less pain after surgery, faster recovery, and joints that feel natural for years to come. My goal is not just to replace a joint--it's to restore your confidence in movement and help you return to the life you love.\"\n\nWhy This Programme is Transforming Orthopaedic Care\n\nAt Jehangir Hospital, every patient receives personalised surgical plans tailored to their anatomy, guided by robotic precision for consistently accurate outcomes. Minimally invasive techniques ensure faster, less painful recovery, while preservation of healthy tissue reduces the risk of complications. All procedures are performed by internationally certified robotic specialists, combining advanced technology with compassionate care. The MAKO advantage enables superior outcomes even in the most complex cases, offering complete orthopaedic care under one roof -- all at no additional cost, making world-class robotic surgery accessible to everyone.\n\nEight Decades of Trust, Now with Tomorrow's Technology\n\nJehangir Hospital's legacy spans more than 8 decades, during which it has remained steadfast in its commitment to patient-first care. The launch of the Advanced Centre for Orthopaedic Robotic Surgery cements its position as the region's most advanced joint replacement destination -- on par with the finest hospitals in the country.\n\nMr. Jehangir H C Jehangir, Chairman, Jehangir Hospital says, \"This state-of-the-art Robotic Programme is a testament to our commitment to advancing technology in healthcare. It reflects our dedication to providing world-class medical care to the society at an affordable cost. We are pleased to see that it has already begun delivering significant benefits to our patients.\"\n\nMr. Vinod Sawantwadkar, CEO, Jehangir Hospital says, \"At Jehangir Hospital, we are committed to staying at the forefront of medical innovation. The launch of our Advanced Robotic Orthopaedic Surgery Clinic underscores our promise to provide patients in Pune and surrounding areas with access to the most advanced healthcare technology available globally. This is not just about sophisticated machines -- it is about transforming patient experiences and outcomes.\"\n\nDr. (Col) S. S. Gill, Medical Director & Director, Medical Research, Jehangir Hospital adds, \"Robotic joint replacement is the state-of-the-art method for precise articulation of the natural joint replaced by prosthesis. Precise articulation includes, matching limb length, joint angulation, joint stability, and ensuring that there is maximum correction of rotational deformities at the joint. This degree of precision also extends to significant muscle and tissue sparing surgery ensuring quicker recovery.The MAKO system is the most superior of all orthopaedic robots as it achieves each of the above advantages with the greatest accuracy. By selecting a MAKO Stryker system, Jehangir Hospital has reaffirmed its vision and mission of providing the best in class care to its patients as to be future ready at all times.\"\n\nFor consultations, contact the Advanced Robotic Orthopaedic Surgery Clinic at Jehangir Hospital today.\n\n(ADVERTORIAL DISCLAIMER: The above press release has been provided by PNN.

    "Title": "Festive stocking, tax relief and GST cuts to drive auto demand in H2FY26; September sales show mixed trend",
    "Explanation": "The Indian automobile industry is heading into the second half of FY26 with cautious optimism, as festive stocking, reduction in GST rates, and income...\n\nThe Indian automobile industry is heading into the second half of FY26 with cautious optimism, as festive stocking, reduction in GST rates, and income tax relief are expected to boost consumer demand, a report said on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, September sales data reflected a mixed trend -- with strong growth in two-wheelers, three-wheelers, commercial vehicles, and tractors, even as passenger vehicle volumes slipped on a Year-on-Year (YoY) basis, Axis Securities highlighted.\n\nTwo Wheeler/Three Wheeler (2W/3W) Segment: Domestic two-wheeler sales rose 6 per cent YoY and 18 per cent month-on-month (MoM), supported by strong performances from Royal Enfield (43 per cent YoY), Suzuki Motorcycle (37 per cent YoY), and TVS Motor (12 per cent YoY).\n\nExports remained firm, rising 17 per cent YoY and 2 per cent MoM, led by Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp, RE, and TVS.\n\nThree-wheeler sales recorded 12 per cent YoY and 6 per cent MoM growth, largely driven by M&M (30 per cent YoY) and TVS (60 per cent YoY), the report noted.\n\nPassenger Vehicles (PV): The PV segment saw a 5 per cent YoY decline in wholesales, though sales rebounded 16 per cent MoM, aided by deferred inventory clearance and GST reductions.\n\nJSW MG Motor and Tata Motors outperformed with 47 per cent and 45 per cent YoY growth, respectively, followed by Toyota Kirloskar (31 per cent YoY) and M&M (10 per cent YoY). Maruti Suzuki, however, slipped 6 per cent YoY, while Hyundai remained flat.\n\nCompany-wise, Tata Motors' PV sales jumped 45 per cent YoY, while M&M's PV division rose 10 per cent YoY. Maruti Suzuki reported a 6 per cent YoY drop in domestic sales, though MoM performance improved 2 per cent.\n\nTractors: The tractor industry witnessed a sharp rebound, with volumes up 50 per cent YoY and 124 per cent MoM, buoyed by good monsoons and high reservoir levels. M&M's tractor sales surged 50 per cent YoY and 148 per cent MoM, Escorts Kubota rose 49 per cent YoY and 125 per cent MoM, while VST Tillers and Tractors posted a 42 per cent YoY gain but fell 27 per cent sequentially.\n\nCommercial Vehicles (CV): Domestic CV sales rose 11 per cent YoY and 19 per cent MoM. Tata Motors and M&M recorded mid-double-digit growth, while Ashok Leyland reported a 9 per cent YoY rise. Eicher Motors' VECV division remained flat YoY, but improved 6 per cent MoM. Maruti Suzuki's CV sales fell 7 per cent YoY.\n\nAxis security said that it remains cautiously optimistic for H2FY26, expecting high single-digit growth in PVs and steady demand in CVs, supported by festive demand, GST cuts, rural recovery, and new model launches.\n\nTractor sales are also expected to remain buoyant, aided by improved kharif harvest and reservoir conditions, the domestic brokerage firm said.",

    "Title": "Festive Stocking, Tax Relief And GST Cuts To Drive Auto Demand In H2FY26; September Sales Show Mixed Trend",
    "Explanation": "New Delhi: The Indian automobile industry is heading into the second half of FY26 with cautious optimism, as festive stocking, reduction in GST rates, and income tax relief are expected to boost consumer demand, a report said on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, September sales data reflected a mixed trend -- with strong growth in two-wheelers, three-wheelers, commercial vehicles, and tractors, even as passenger vehicle volumes slipped on a Year-on-Year (YoY) basis, Axis Securities highlighted.\n\nTwo Wheeler/Three Wheeler (2W/3W) Segment: Domestic two-wheeler sales rose 6 per cent YoY and 18 per cent month-on-month (MoM), supported by strong performances from Royal Enfield (43 per cent YoY), Suzuki Motorcycle (37 per cent YoY), and TVS Motor (12 per cent YoY).\n\nExports remained firm, rising 17 per cent YoY and 2 per cent MoM, led by Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp, RE, and TVS.\n\nThree-wheeler sales recorded 12 per cent YoY and 6 per cent MoM growth, largely driven by M&M (30 per cent YoY) and TVS (60 per cent YoY), the report noted.\n\nPassenger Vehicles (PV): The PV segment saw a 5 per cent YoY decline in wholesales, though sales rebounded 16 per cent MoM, aided by deferred inventory clearance and GST reductions.\n\nJSW MG Motor and Tata Motors outperformed with 47 per cent and 45 per cent YoY growth, respectively, followed by Toyota Kirloskar (31 per cent YoY) and M&M (10 per cent YoY). Maruti Suzuki, however, slipped 6 per cent YoY, while Hyundai remained flat.\n\nCompany-wise, Tata Motors' PV sales jumped 45 per cent YoY, while M&M's PV division rose 10 per cent YoY. Maruti Suzuki reported a 6 per cent YoY drop in domestic sales, though MoM performance improved 2 per cent.\n\nTractors: The tractor industry witnessed a sharp rebound, with volumes up 50 per cent YoY and 124 per cent MoM, buoyed by good monsoons and high reservoir levels. M&M's tractor sales surged 50 per cent YoY and 148 per cent MoM, Escorts Kubota rose 49 per cent YoY and 125 per cent MoM, while VST Tillers and Tractors posted a 42 per cent YoY gain but fell 27 per cent sequentially.\n\nCommercial Vehicles (CV): Domestic CV sales rose 11 per cent YoY and 19 per cent MoM. Tata Motors and M&M recorded mid-double-digit growth, while Ashok Leyland reported a 9 per cent YoY rise. Eicher Motors' VECV division remained flat YoY, but improved 6 per cent MoM. Maruti Suzuki's CV sales fell 7 per cent YoY.\n\nAxis security said that it remains cautiously optimistic for H2FY26, expecting high single-digit growth in PVs and steady demand in CVs, supported by festive demand, GST cuts, rural recovery, and new model launches.\n\nTractor sales are also expected to remain buoyant, aided by improved kharif harvest and reservoir conditions, the domestic brokerage firm said.",

    "Explanation": "New Delhi, October 3: Tata Motors demerger came into effect on October 1, 2025, marking the start of a new phase for the automaker. The company has now been separated into two distinct, publicly listed companies. The Tata Motors division is divided into two entities, one dedicated to commercial vehicles (CV) and one dedicated to passenger vehicles (PV). The restructuring was approved earlier by the board, regulators, and the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in compliance with legal and governance standards. Tata Motors has also announced the record date for demerger.\n\nThe demerger is intended to enable each division to function independently to focus on its unique market needs, growth opportunities, and capital requirements. Tata Motors seeks to strengthen operational efficiency and provide its shareholders with greater value through focused and efficient business management. Rahul Gandhi Hails Indian Two-Wheeler Manufacturers, Says 'Proud To See Bajaj, Hero & TVS Do So Well in Colombia'.\n\nAs per reports, Tata Motors commercial vehicle business covering buses, trucks, and other heavy-duty models is overseen by Girish Wagh. The passenger vehicle arm, which includes cars, SUVs, electric models, and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is under the leadership of Shailesh Chandra. As per reports, the share entitlement ratio will be 1:1, so that Tata Motors shareholders will hold the same proportion in both companies.\n\nAs per a report of The Economic Times, Tata Motors has set October 14, 2025, as the record date for the planned demerger of its commercial vehicle division. On this day, each Tata Motors shareholder will be allotted one fully paid share of TMLCV for every share they own in Tata Motors, with each share carrying a face value of INR 2. These shares are proposed to be listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE), once all regulatory approvals are completed.

    "Title": "Tata Motors Trumps Hyundai, Mahindra In Sept'25 Sales, Secures Second Spot",
    "Explanation": "Tata Motors became the second-best-selling carmaker in the Indian market in September 2025. Racing past Mahindra and Hyundai, the automaker has registered strong sales in the SUV and electric vehicle segment. Furthermore, the Indian manufacturer also widened its gap with JSW MG Motor India in the EV segment.\n\nAccording to data from the Vahan portal provided by the government, Tata has moved up from fourth place last year to second, now trailing only market leader Maruti Suzuki. The performance in September signifies a return to the second spot after briefly holding it in March of this year.\n\nAlso Read: Maruti Suzuki Victoris Gets 25,000 Bookings; Deliveries Begin\n\nIn September, Tata recorded 40,594 vehicle sales, reflecting a 28 percent increase compared to 31,581 units sold in the same month last year. Hyundai has dropped to fourth place with 35,443 registrations, declining from 37,666, while Mahindra increased its sales to 37,015 units but remained in third place. Maruti Suzuki continued to lead the market with 122,278 vehicles registered, up from 113,560.\n\nHyundai's slip to fourth is an indication of lower demand for its Creta and Venue models, while its premium electric vehicles, such as the Ioniq 5 and Creta EV, continue to cater to a niche market. Mahindra maintained its third-place ranking with popular models, including the Scorpio-N, Bolero, XUV700, and Thar, although its mass-market electric vehicles are not expected until 2026.\n\nThe Tata Nexon SUV drove record sales, achieving its highest monthly sales ever for any Tata model with over 22,500 units sold. The mid-size SUV models, the Harrier and Safari, also sustained strong performance, reaching their highest combined sales figures to date.\n\nIn the realm of green mobility, electric vehicle sales nearly doubled, experiencing a 96 percent year-over-year increase to 9,191 units. Likewise, CNG vehicle sales reached a record high of over 17,800 units, showcasing a growth of more than 105 percent compared to Q2 FY25.\n\nShow full article\n\nTrack Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India and around the world\n\nTata Motors, Hyundai, Mahindra, Tata Motors Sales",

      "title": "Tata Motors Trumps Hyundai, Mahindra In Sept'25 Sales, Secures Second Spot",
      "body": "Tata Motors became the second-best-selling carmaker in the Indian market in September 2025. Racing past Mahindra and Hyundai, the automaker has registered strong sales in the SUV and electric vehicle segment. Furthermore, the Indian manufacturer also widened its gap with JSW MG Motor India in the EV segment.\n\nAccording to data from the Vahan portal provided by the government, Tata has moved up from fourth place last year to second, now trailing only market leader Maruti Suzuki. The performance in September signifies a return to the second spot after briefly holding it in March of this year.\n\nAlso Read: Maruti Suzuki Victoris Gets 25,000 Bookings; Deliveries Begin\n\nIn September, Tata recorded 40,594 vehicle sales, reflecting a 28 percent increase compared to 31,581 units sold in the same month last year. Hyundai has dropped to fourth place with 35,443 registrations, declining from 37,666, while Mahindra increased its sales to 37,015 units but remained in third place. Maruti Suzuki continued to lead the market with 122,278 vehicles registered, up from 113,560.\n\nHyundai's slip to fourth is an indication of lower demand for its Creta and Venue models, while its premium electric vehicles, such as the Ioniq 5 and Creta EV, continue to cater to a niche market. Mahindra maintained its third-place ranking with popular models, including the Scorpio-N, Bolero, XUV700, and Thar, although its mass-market electric vehicles are not expected until 2026.\n\nThe Tata Nexon SUV drove record sales, achieving its highest monthly sales ever for any Tata model with over 22,500 units sold. The mid-size SUV models, the Harrier and Safari, also sustained strong performance, reaching their highest combined sales figures to date.\n\nIn the realm of green mobility, electric vehicle sales nearly doubled, experiencing a 96 percent year-over-year increase to 9,191 units. Likewise, CNG vehicle sales reached a record high of over 17,800 units, showcasing a growth of more than 105 percent compared to Q2 FY25.\n\nShow full article\n\nTrack Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India and around the world\n\nTata Motors, Hyundai, Mahindra, Tata Motors Sales",

    "Title": "Best Navratri In Decade For Car Sales: Maruti, SUV Sales Fuel India's Strongest Festive Surge In 10 Years",
    "Explanation": "India's carmakers have led the charge in what turned out to be the strongest Navratri sales season in over a decade, setting the stage for a blockbuster Diwali, The Economic Times reported.\n\nMaruti Suzuki, the country's top car manufacturer, recorded its best-ever Navratri sales in at least 10 years, with sales doubling compared to last year. As of Wednesday, there were 700,530 enquiries for the cars and 150,000 bookings, with expectations to touch 200,000 bookings by Thursday evening. Last year, the company sold 85,000 vehicles during Navratri.\n\nMahindra & Mahindra also rode the festive wave, reporting a 60% jump in retails, driven by its popular SUVs XUV700 and Scorpio N. Hyundai witnessed strong demand for the Creta and Venue, with SUVs contributing more than 72% of its total sales. Hero MotoCorp, meanwhile, reported double showroom footfalls with commuter bikes seeing robust traction.\n\nTata Motors joined the festive success story by retailing over 50,000 vehicles during the period, with Altroz, Punch, Nexon, and Tiago leading the charge.\n\nBeyond automobiles, the festive cheer spread across consumer electronics and retail. LG, Haier, and Godrej Appliances posted high double-digit growth, with Haier's sales soaring 85% and premium TV models nearly sold out. \"The Navratri sales this year were driven by the direct benefit of the GST rate cut and the indirect boost it gave to customer sentiment,\" said Satish NS, president of Haier India, told the English publication.\n\nLG's Sanjay Chitkara echoed the optimism, describing the growth as \"exponential.\"\n\nRetail too saw strong gains, with Reliance Retail reporting a 20-25% jump in sales compared to last year. Footfalls at malls picked up steadily after Amazon and Flipkart's mega online sales, bringing fresh momentum to offline stores.\n\nThe Economic Times report highlights that this year's Navratri demand surged between 25% and 100% across categories, marking a sharp turnaround after five to six years of sluggish consumption. With the first half of the festive season already proving buoyant, companies are now gearing up for Diwali, Dhanteras, and the wedding season - all expected to add further sparkle to India's consumption story.",

LG, Haier, and Godrej Appliances posted high double-digit growth, with Haier's sales soaring 85% and premium TV models nearly sold out. \"The Navratri sales this year were driven by the direct benefit of the GST rate cut and the indirect boost it gave to customer sentiment,\" said Satish NS, president of Haier India, told the English publication.\n\nLG's Sanjay Chitkara echoed the optimism, describing the growth as \"exponential.\"\n\nRetail too saw strong gains, with Reliance Retail reporting a 20-25% jump in sales compared to last year. Footfalls at malls picked up steadily after Amazon and Flipkart's mega online sales, bringing fresh momentum to offline stores.\n\nThe Economic Times report highlights that this year's Navratri demand surged between 25% and 100% across categories, marking a sharp turnaround after five to six years of sluggish consumption. With the first half of the festive season already proving buoyant, companies are now gearing up for Diwali, Dhanteras, and the wedding season - all expected to add further sparkle to India's consumption story.",

    "Title": "September '25 Car Sales: Maruti on top, this brand climbs to 2nd spot! - The Times of India",
    "Explanation": "September 2025 saw a mixed performance in India's car market. Maruti Suzuki retained dominance despite domestic sales dips, while Tata Motors achieved record sales, driven by Nexon, EV, and CNG models. Hyundai and Mahindra also posted strong growth, though Honda Cars India experienced a significant sales decline.The introduction of GST 2.0 and the onset of the festive season made September 2025 a crucial month for India's car market. However, the results were a mixed bag. While some brands rode the tax relief and festive demand to record-breaking numbers, others faced pressure in their entry-level offerings. The overall market also saw a reshuffle in rankings. Here's how the month has been for the major mass-market OEMs.At the top, Maruti Suzuki India continued its dominance with 189,665 units sold. The company's exports were the standout, hitting an all-time high of 42,204 units, up 52% from a year ago. However, domestic passenger vehicle sales slipped 8% to 132,820 units, weighed down by slower demand for entry-level cars and utility vehicles. Despite the dip, Maruti benefited from strong festive buying, clocking 1.65 lakh deliveries during Navratri's opening week, laying the ground for a busy October.The headline-grabber of the month, though, was Tata Motors. The homegrown giant recorded its best-ever monthly performance with 60,907 cars sold, surging 47% year-on-year. Leading the charge was the Nexon, which registered more than 22,500 units: the highest-ever monthly sales for any single Tata model. EV sales nearly doubled to 9,191 units, and CNG models scaled past 17,800 units.Meanwhile, Mahindra & Mahindra reported a 16% YoY increase in overall sales to 1,00,298 units. Within this, utility vehicles accounted for 56,233 units, a 10% rise, while exports grew 43% to 4,320 units.Hyundai Motor India had a strong month as well, posting 70,347 units, up 10% from last year. Domestic sales stood at 51,547 units. SUVs contributed a record 72.4% of Hyundai's volumes, with the Creta (18,861 units) notching its highest-ever sales and the Venue (11,484 units) hitting a 20-month high. Exports rose sharply to 18,800 units, a growth of 44% year-on-year.Other players also reported growth: Toyota Kirloskar Motor delivered 31,091 units, up 16% from last year, while Kia India sold 22,700 units, reflecting nearly 16% growth over August. JSW MG Motor India posted 6,728 units, up 34% year-on-year.Honda Cars India, however, saw sales drop 26% to 8,096 units, with domestic volumes at 5,303 units and exports at 2,793 units.",

    "Title": "Tata Motors Q2 FY26 Sales Commercial Vehicles Sales Registered by Tata Motors Ltd in Q2 FY26",
    "Explanation": "Sales in the domestic & international market for Q2 FY26 stood at 94,681 units, compared to 84,281 units during Q2 FY25.\n\nDomestic sales of MH&ICV in September 2025, was 15,669 units vs 14,190 units in September 2024; In Q2 FY26 it was 41,461 units, compared to 37,372 units in Q2 FY25.\n\nDomestic & International sales for MH&ICV in September 2025, was 16,759 units vs 14,839 units in September 2024; while in Q2 FY26 it stood at 45,095 units, vs 39,433 units in Q2 FY25.\n\nMr. Girish Wagh, Executive Director of Tata Motors Ltd., said, \"Q2 FY26 was a mixed quarter for the commercial vehicles industry, start marked by subdued market conditions and ending with a promising resurgence in demand. While July faced headwinds due to monsoon and August reflected cautious sentiment ahead of the GST 2.0 rollout, the onset of the festive season and lower GST rates from late September brought a good recovery in sales, bookings and sentiment.\n\nFollowing the GST reduction announcement, we acted swiftly and decisively to capture the growth in demand -- by enhancing product availability, sharpening our pricing strategy, and intensifying market activations. These initiatives helped us unlock demand across segments, making September our best-performing sales month in FY26, driven by a strong 30% YoY growth in our SCV and PU portfolio led by the new launches, Ace Pro and Ace Gold+.\n\nOverall, in Q2 FY26, Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles delivered sales of 94,681 units, registering a growth of 12% over the same period last year. We continue to build strong differentiation for our expansive range of trucks that now offer higher power output of up to 320hp. With smart engineering and a relentless focus on operational efficiency, our trucks remain the preferred choice for fleet owners seeking better performance, higher profits and long-term value.\n\nLooking ahead, with the festive season underway, improving consumption, and the full impact of GST reforms yet to unfold, we anticipate a strong second half for FY26. Construction, infrastructure, and mining activities will gain momentum, further fueling demand for trucks and tippers. With a robust pipeline of upcoming launches, and a richer, more customer-aligned product portfolio, we are well-positioned to accelerate this momentum and drive meaningful, broad-based growth across all commercial vehicles segments.\"\n\nPassenger Vehicles Sales Registered by Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd in Q2 FY26\n\nSales in the domestic & international market for Q2 FY26 stood at 144,397 units, compared to 130,753 units during Q2 FY25.\n\nIncludes sales of Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Limited, subsidiary of Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd.\n\nMr. Shailesh Chandra, Managing Director, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd. said, \"The passenger vehicles industry marked a sharp upswing in demand during September 2025 following the rollout of GST 2.0, further buoyed by festive tailwinds. This surge in demand sets a promising tone for sustained growth in the months ahead.\n\nFor Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles, September 2025 emerged as a watershed month with sales of 60,907 units (domestic wholesales of 59,667 units), our highest ever, marking a substantial 47% year-on-year growth. This milestone was complimented by record-breaking performances across our green fuel portfolio: EV sales surged 96%+ year-on-year to 9,191 units, setting a new benchmark, while CNG sales reached an all-time high of over 17,800 units, reflecting a remarkable 105%+ growth compared to Q2FY25.\n\nAcross our portfolio, customer interest remained exceptionally strong with new bookings doubling in the latter half of September following the lowering of GST rates. Leading this surge was the Nexon, which delivered a record-breaking performance with over 22,500 units sold in a single month, marking the highest-ever sales for any Tata Motors passenger vehicle. The Harrier and Safari continued their upward momentum, fueled by the rising popularity of their newly launched Adventure X edition and the availability of multiple powertrain options, leading to their best-ever combined sales. Additionally, the Punch continued to expand its widespread appeal, further cementing its status as the popular choice among customers in the compact SUV segment.\n\nIn Q2 FY26, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles delivered sales of 144,397 units, registering a robust, double-digit year-on-year (YoY) growth of more than 10%. While the entire product portfolio saw strong traction, our electric vehicle strategy stood out prominently. Quarterly EV sales surged 59% YoY to nearly 25,000 units, recording our highest-ever EV performance and contributing a record 17% to overall sales. This milestone underscores the growing consumer confidence in sustainable, zero-emission mobility. Additionally, our strategic foray into South Africa marked a significant milestone in our global expansion journey, with 5x export volumes compared to the previous year, highlighting the strength of our brand and product appeal in international markets.\n\nGoing forward, with a strong booking pipeline, agile supply readiness, and rising demand driven by festive cheer and accessible pricing, we are well-positioned to carry this growth momentum in H2 FY26.\"\n\nImportant Note: Pursuant to the Composite Scheme of Arrangement approved by the Hon'ble National Company Law Tribunal, effective October 1, 2025, Tata Motors has demerged its Commercial Vehicles business into TML Commercial Vehicles Limited (TMLCV), and consolidated the Passenger Vehicles business within the parent entity.\n\nSales figures referenced in this release pertain to the quarter ended September 30, 2025, prior to the scheme's effective date. Following the allotment and listing of TMLCV shares (record date for which has been fixed as October 14, 2025), both listed entities will independently publish their respective press releases going forward.",

With a robust pipeline of upcoming launches, and a richer, more customer-aligned product portfolio, we are well-positioned to accelerate this momentum and drive meaningful, broad-based growth across all commercial vehicles segments.\"\n\nPassenger Vehicles Sales Registered by Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd in Q2 FY26\n\nSales in the domestic & international market for Q2 FY26 stood at 144,397 units, compared to 130,753 units during Q2 FY25.\n\nIncludes sales of Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Limited, subsidiary of Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd.\n\nMr. Shailesh Chandra, Managing Director, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd. said, \"The passenger vehicles industry marked a sharp upswing in demand during September 2025 following the rollout of GST 2.0, further buoyed by festive tailwinds. This surge in demand sets a promising tone for sustained growth in the months ahead.\n\nFor Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles, September 2025 emerged as a watershed month with sales of 60,907 units (domestic wholesales of 59,667 units), our highest ever, marking a substantial 47% year-on-year growth. This milestone was complimented by record-breaking performances across our green fuel portfolio: EV sales surged 96%+ year-on-year to 9,191 units, setting a new benchmark, while CNG sales reached an all-time high of over 17,800 units, reflecting a remarkable 105%+ growth compared to Q2FY25.\n\nAcross our portfolio, customer interest remained exceptionally strong with new bookings doubling in the latter half of September following the lowering of GST rates. Leading this surge was the Nexon, which delivered a record-breaking performance with over 22,500 units sold in a single month, marking the highest-ever sales for any Tata Motors passenger vehicle. The Harrier and Safari continued their upward momentum, fueled by the rising popularity of their newly launched Adventure X edition and the availability of multiple powertrain options, leading to their best-ever combined sales. Additionally, the Punch continued to expand its widespread appeal, further cementing its status as the popular choice among customers in the compact SUV segment.\n\nIn Q2 FY26, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles delivered sales of 144,397 units, registering a robust, double-digit year-on-year (YoY) growth of more than 10%. While the entire product portfolio saw strong traction, our electric vehicle strategy stood out prominently. Quarterly EV sales surged 59% YoY to nearly 25,000 units, recording our highest-ever EV performance and contributing a record 17% to overall sales. This milestone underscores the growing consumer confidence in sustainable, zero-emission mobility. Additionally, our strategic foray into South Africa marked a significant milestone in our global expansion journey, with 5x export volumes compared to the previous year, highlighting the strength of our brand and product appeal in international markets.\n\nGoing forward, with a strong booking pipeline, agile supply readiness, and rising demand driven by festive cheer and accessible pricing, we are well-positioned to carry this growth momentum in H2 FY26.\"\n\nImportant Note: Pursuant to the Composite Scheme of Arrangement approved by the Hon'ble National Company Law Tribunal, effective October 1, 2025, Tata Motors has demerged its Commercial Vehicles business into TML Commercial Vehicles Limited (TMLCV), and consolidated the Passenger Vehicles business within the parent entity.\n\nSales figures referenced in this release pertain to the quarter ended September 30, 2025, prior to the scheme's effective date. Following the allotment and listing of TMLCV shares (record date for which has been fixed as October 14, 2025), both listed entities will independently publish their respective press releases going forward.",

    "Title": "Tata Motors demerger: No capital gains tax on receipt but be careful when you sell",
    "Explanation": "The demerger of Tata Motors, effective October 1, will separate the automotive major's commercial vehicle (CV) and passenger vehicle (PV) businesses into two independent listed companies.\n\nThose holding shares of Tata Motors on October 14 , the record date, will get one equity share of the new CV company for every one share they hold in Tata Motors. TML Commercial Vehicles Ltd is expected to list by early November.\n\nMoneycontrol takes a look at how capital gains tax works on sale of shares after a demerger:\n\nThe cost of acquisition\n\nWhen a company demerges and you receive new shares, it's not \"free\" stock. You need to split your original cost of acquisition between the original company and the new one based on their net book values (NBV), not on the market price.\n\n\"Listed companies generally disclose the exact apportionment ratio in their corporate announcements or through exchanges. Investors should simply apply that ratio to their original purchase price,\" said Kunal Sharma, founder & managing partner, Taraksh Lawyers & Consultants.\n\n\"Most companies publish this ratio, for example 60:40, either in their scheme of arrangement or via communications from the registrar and Transfer Agent (RTA). So if you bought shares for Rs 1,000 originally, Rs 600 becomes the cost of the old company and Rs 400 becomes the cost for the new one. This is the simplest, most accurate way to do it even for small investors,\" said Shreya Jaiswal, chartered accountant and founder, Fawkes Solutions, a brand strategy firm.\n\nThe same methodology will apply when Tata Motors' percentage ratio for NBV is announced.\n\nAs of now, at the time you get these new shares on demerger, there is no tax implication. You just have a new share in your demat account and you have to disclose the purchase price.\n\nSection 47(vib)/(vid)/(vb) of the income-tax act provides a clear relief: the transfer of shares under a scheme of demerger is not treated as a taxable transfer in the hands of shareholders.\n\n\"This means that simply receiving shares of the resulting company does not trigger capital gains tax. Tax arises only when the investor actually sells the shares,\" Sharma said.\n\nFor retail investors, there is no special exemption beyond this. The cost of acquisition is apportioned under Section 49(2C)/(2D), and the holding period carries over.\n\nHolding period and capital gains\n\n\"When shares are eventually sold, capital gains are computed in the usual way, based on the split cost and carried-over holding period,\" Sharma said.\n\nIn a demerger, the law ensures continuity. Section 2(42A) of the I-T act says the holding period of the resulting company's shares is deemed to include the holding period of the parent company's shares. Simply put, the \"clock\" does not restart.\n\n\"Thus, if an investor had held the parent shares for more than 12 months before the demerger, both the parent and the resulting company's shares will qualify as long-term,\" Sharma said.\n\nEven where the parent shares were acquired in different lots, the respective acquisition dates of those lots continue for the proportionate demerged shares. For retail investors, the guiding principle is simple: the age of your shares remains the same after a demerger.\n\nThis means that your holding period doesn't reset after a demerger. If you bought shares in 2021 and the demerger happened in 2023, the holding period for both the old and new company counts from 2021. \"This matters because it often pushes your gains into the long-term capital gains (LTCG) bracket, which is taxed more favourably. Many investors don't realise this and end up misreporting or overpaying tax,\" Jaiswal said.\n\nIn case both Tata Motors and the demerged company declare dividends separately, tax will be deducted at source, and the dividend will be taxed as income from other sources. \"This is the standard taxation, separate from capital gains, so investors need to account for it while filing returns,\" said Vivek Jalan, partner, Tax Connect Advisory Services.\n\nAvoid penalties: track demerged shares right\n\nKeep the original communication from the company or RTA that shows the NBV ratio. Label your shares manually in your demat spreadsheet or in your trading account. When you sell, cross-check your cost basis with what you initially calculated not just what the platform tells you.\n\n\"If you're filing your return, report these sales properly under Schedule 112A. Many tax software platforms support this now but your numbers need to be correct,\" said Jaiswal.",

    "Title": "Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Tata Motors, Mahindra: PV sales snapshot september 2025",
    "Explanation": "The September 2025 sales chart for India's passenger vehicle (PV) market isn't just a list of numbers; it's a strategy ledger. Beneath the surface of early festive cheer and GST 2.0 nudges, a complex, almost defensive game is being played by the top four, and what stands out is the growing anxiety about domestic growth. Here's the true read on what the Big Four are signaling.\n\nLet's get to the point: The 8 per cent domestic sales decline of Maruti Suzuki is the key takeaway, a clear indicator that the ground is indeed slipping from under their feet as competition is heating up. The golden days of easy volume growth in the domestic market are behind us.\n\nBut to regard their export boom to an all-time high of 42,200 units as a footnote, or a mere 'red flag', is to overlook the long-game strategic genius. Maruti is not merely exporting excess inventory abroad; they are proactively leveraging their gigantic production scale to de-risk the entire business model. This export boom is a very efficient, scripted hedge against volatility in the domestic market.\n\nThe 4 per cent month-on-month (MoM) uptick in total sales from August is proof that this dual-focus strategy is working as intended. While the workhorses like the Brezza, Dzire, and WagonR continue to keep the domestic lights on, the global market is providing the necessary structural buoyancy. The question isn't whether they're slowing down, but how effectively they've engineered a safety valve for when domestic momentum inevitably softens.\n\nHyundai and Mahindra are essentially in a race to see who can build the better SUV fortress.\n\nHyundai's numbers are staggering: SUVs now account for over 70 per cent of their domestic sales, powered by the Creta and Venue. This is a brilliant, opportunistic pivot that capitalizes on both buyer preference and the GST 2.0 benefits. Their 3.3 per cent MoM growth is clean, steady, and entirely driven by utility. The risk? They are becoming dangerously dependent on a single body style. What happens when, inevitably, the Indian buyer's preference swings back, even partially, toward sedans or premium hatchbacks? Their portfolio breadth, once a strength, is now being overshadowed by this SUV obsession.\n\nMahindra, meanwhile, is content in its domain. The brand is built on rugged, premium SUVs, and they are holding the line with a solid 3.5 per cent MoM growth and 56,200 domestic sales. Their low export numbers (500 units) reaffirm their ultra-focused domestic strategy. They aren't trying to be all things to all people; they are purely the SUV specialist. It's a high-margin, stable model, but it lacks the scale-up potential of their rivals.\n\nThe real story of September belongs to Tata Motors. They didn't just sell well; they overtook Hyundai and Mahindra with 58,000 domestic units, executing a strategic masterpiece powered by EVs and CNG. Their 4.2 per cent MoM rise is the strongest and most strategically sound of the group.\n\nThis is the sound of market consolidation, not just cyclical buying. Tata is winning because they have correctly identified two things: first, that alternative fuels are the growth engine (aided by policy and discounts), and second, that they can command domestic loyalty. The single-day record of 10,000 sales proves that pricing, green technology, and festival timing create a demand multiplier that their rivals are struggling to match. Their strategy is firmly rooted in transforming the Indian buyer's vehicle choice, not just selling them another car.\n\nSeptember 2025 shows us an industry shedding its old skin. Volume is secondary to strategic alignment.",

This is a brilliant, opportunistic pivot that capitalizes on both buyer preference and the GST 2.0 benefits. Their 3.3 per cent MoM growth is clean, steady, and entirely driven by utility. The risk? They are becoming dangerously dependent on a single body style. What happens when, inevitably, the Indian buyer's preference swings back, even partially, toward sedans or premium hatchbacks? Their portfolio breadth, once a strength, is now being overshadowed by this SUV obsession.\n\nMahindra, meanwhile, is content in its domain. The brand is built on rugged, premium SUVs, and they are holding the line with a solid 3.5 per cent MoM growth and 56,200 domestic sales. Their low export numbers (500 units) reaffirm their ultra-focused domestic strategy. They aren't trying to be all things to all people; they are purely the SUV specialist. It's a high-margin, stable model, but it lacks the scale-up potential of their rivals.\n\nThe real story of September belongs to Tata Motors. They didn't just sell well; they overtook Hyundai and Mahindra with 58,000 domestic units, executing a strategic masterpiece powered by EVs and CNG. Their 4.2 per cent MoM rise is the strongest and most strategically sound of the group.\n\nThis is the sound of market consolidation, not just cyclical buying. Tata is winning because they have correctly identified two things: first, that alternative fuels are the growth engine (aided by policy and discounts), and second, that they can command domestic loyalty. The single-day record of 10,000 sales proves that pricing, green technology, and festival timing create a demand multiplier that their rivals are struggling to match. Their strategy is firmly rooted in transforming the Indian buyer's vehicle choice, not just selling them another car.\n\nSeptember 2025 shows us an industry shedding its old skin. Volume is secondary to strategic alignment.",
