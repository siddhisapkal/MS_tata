    "Explanation": "In 2020, Apple added a digital car key feature to its Wallet app, allowing users to lock, unlock, and start a compatible vehicle with an iPhone or Apple Watch. The feature is currently offered by select automakers, including Audi, BMW, Hyundai, Kia, Genesis, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, and a handful of others, and it is set to expand further.\n\nDuring its WWDC 2025 keynote in June, Apple said that 13 additional vehicle brands would \"soon\" offer iPhone car keys, including Acura, Chevrolet, Cadillac, GMC, Porsche, Rivian, Smart, Lucid Motors, Tata Motors, Hongqi, WEY, Chery, and Voyah.\n\nApple did not provide an exact timeframe or any other details.\n\nLast month, MacRumors contributor Aaron Perris uncovered evidence that Apple was preparing for the feature to launch in select Smart and Voyah vehicles.",

    "Explanation": "The demerger is a part of the firm's broader strategy to create focused verticals within the group each with independent governance and growth plans\n\nTata Motors (TML) on Friday said it has completed the demerger of its commercial vehicles (CV) business and the transfer of related group companies to TML Commercial Vehicles (TMLCV), as per the regulatory filings.\n\nThe development follows the sanction of the Composite Scheme of Arrangement by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Mumbai Bench, on August 25, 2025, with a subsequent rectification order on September 10, 2025.\n\nThe scheme, executed under Sections 230-232 of the Companies Act, 2013, enables the separation of the commercial vehicle and passenger vehicle businesses into distinct legal entities.\n\nPursuant to the scheme becoming effective, Tata Motors has transferred its entire shareholding in a wide range of direct and indirect subsidiaries, associates, and joint ventures to TMLCV.\n\nUnder the arrangement, Tata Motors' shareholding in several wholly-owned subsidiaries -- including Tata Motors Insurance Broking and Advisory Services, Tata Hispano Motors Carrocera, Tata Motors Body Solutions, TML CV Mobility Solutions, TMF Holdings, and TML Smart City Mobility Solutions -- now rests with TMLCV.\n\nThe demerger also includes indirect subsidiaries such as Tata Daewoo Mobility Company, PT Tata Motors Indonesia, TML CV Holdings, and TML CV Holdings, alongside their associated entities.\n\nIn addition, shareholdings in key associate companies -- including Automobile Corporation of Goa (49.77 per cent ), Tata Hitachi Construction Machinery Company (39.99 per cent ), and Freight Commerce Solutions (42.11 per cent on a fully diluted basis) -- have been transferred to TMLCV.\n\nJoint operations and ventures such as Tata Cummins, TCPL Green Energy Solutions, Tata Motors Digital.AI Labs, and Tata Motors Global Services are also part of the transfer.\n\nThe demerger is a part of Tata Motors' broader strategy to create focused verticals within the group -- commercial vehicles, passenger vehicles, and electric mobility -- each with independent governance and growth plans. The separation is expected to provide greater operational agility and enable each business to pursue its market-specific priorities.\n\nThe company has stated that all transfers are effective from the date of implementation of the scheme, and have been notified to stock exchanges, including BSE and NSE.",

    "Title": "Tata Motors Sells Record 60,907 Cars In September - EV & CNG Sales Double",
    "Explanation": "Tata Motors set a new benchmark in September 2025, reporting its highest-ever monthly passenger vehicle sales. Tata Motors sold 60,907 passenger vehicles last month, including 59,667 units in the domestic market, registering a massive 45.3 per cent year-on-year increase.\n\nExports played a role in this record as well, with 1,240 units shipped overseas compared to just 250 units in the same month last year. That surge reflects a 396 per cent rise and underlines Tata's growing presence in international markets.\n\nTogether, green fuel models (EV + CNG) made up 44 per cent of Tata's overall sales in the quarter. This aligns with the company's broader strategy of offering multiple sustainable powertrain options across its lineup.\n\nIn model-wise performance, the Nexon emerged as the leader with over 22,500 units sold in September - its best-ever single month. Meanwhile, the Harrier and Safari achieved their strongest combined sales, helped by the introduction of the new Adventure X edition.\n\nThe industry-wide GST 2.0 rollout and the festive season provided a clear boost. New tax structures brought down effective prices in some categories, encouraging faster decision-making among buyers and lifting footfalls in showrooms nationwide.\n\nTata Motors Sales - September 2025\n\nShailesh Chandra, Managing Director, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles said,\n\n\"The passenger vehicles industry marked a sharp upswing in demand during September 2025 following the rollout of GST 2.0, further buoyed by festive tailwinds. This surge in demand sets a promising tone for sustained growth in the months ahead. September 2025 emerged as a watershed month with sales of 60,907 units (domestic wholesales of 59,667 units), our highest ever, marking a substantial 47% year-on-year growth. EV sales surged 96%+ while CNG sales reached an all-time high of over 17,800 units.\"\n\nThe momentum was visible in the quarter results, too. Tata's Q2 FY26 PV sales stood at 144,397 units, up 10.4 per cent year-on-year. Domestic numbers hit 140,189 units, while exports climbed to 4,208 units with 411 per cent growth.\n\nThis record surge also altered market rankings. Tata Motors has now climbed to second spot in India's auto market, overtaking Hyundai and Mahindra.",

    "Title": "Nexon EV 45 real-life range test: How far can Tata's popular electric SUV go on a single charge?",
    "Explanation": "It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that the Tata Nexon EV has been one of the key drivers in popularising electric cars in India. Over the years, Tata Motors has continuously refined the Nexon EV, making it not only one of the most successful EVs in the country but also the best-selling model since its debut. In its latest update, the brand introduced a new top-spec version with a larger 45 kWh battery pack. With this update, the 40 kWh variant has been discontinued, although the 30 kWh entry-level option remains available. Naturally, when it comes to EVs, the most important question buyers ask is: \"How far will it go on a single charge?\" To find out, we took the Nexon EV 45 out for a real-world range test.\n\nIn our test, the Nexon EV 45 managed to deliver around 330 km on a single charge. Of course, this figure can vary based on driving style and conditions -- going downhill or driving more gently can stretch the range further, while uphill climbs or a heavy right foot will bring it down.\n\nOn paper, Tata Motors claims an MIDC range of 489 km, while the C75 rating sits between 350 and 375 km. To keep things consistent, we drove the SUV in Eco mode, using regen level 2 in city traffic and level 1 on the highways -- since the highest setting (level 3) feels too aggressive, and coasting works better on open stretches. Comfort features like air-conditioning (set at 24°C, fan speed 2-3) and the driver's ventilated seat were kept on throughout the drive.\n\nOne of the highlights of the Nexon EV 45 is its suspension setup. It does a commendable job of ironing out potholes and uneven surfaces, making city driving quite comfortable. That said, the weight of the large battery pack is noticeable, especially at higher speeds where you feel some body roll and lateral movement on long straights. This is where something like an MG Windsor EV Pro feels more confident and stable.\n\n(Also read: Living with the Tata Nexon EV for over 1,000 km. Here's what we learned)\n\nThe panoramic sunroof -- exclusive to the 45 kWh variant -- adds to the premium feel, and the inclusion of a small frunk under the hood is a practical touch for extra storage. There is also window sunshades available for the rear occupants. During our test, we did encounter a minor glitch with the instrument cluster, where the display information overlapped and became cluttered, something Tata will hopefully iron out in future updates.",

    "Title": "Tata Motors Demerger: Automaker Announces Record Date for Demerger of Its Commercial Vehicles Business on October 14 | 🚘 LatestLY",
    "Explanation": "New Delhi, October 3: Tata Motors demerger came into effect on October 1, 2025, marking the start of a new phase for the automaker. The company has now been separated into two distinct, publicly listed companies. The Tata Motors division is divided into two entities, one dedicated to commercial vehicles (CV) and one dedicated to passenger vehicles (PV). The restructuring was approved earlier by the board, regulators, and the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in compliance with legal and governance standards. Tata Motors has also announced the record date for demerger.\n\nThe demerger is intended to enable each division to function independently to focus on its unique market needs, growth opportunities, and capital requirements. Tata Motors seeks to strengthen operational efficiency and provide its shareholders with greater value through focused and efficient business management. Rahul Gandhi Hails Indian Two-Wheeler Manufacturers, Says 'Proud To See Bajaj, Hero & TVS Do So Well in Colombia'.\n\nAs per reports, Tata Motors commercial vehicle business covering buses, trucks, and other heavy-duty models is overseen by Girish Wagh. The passenger vehicle arm, which includes cars, SUVs, electric models, and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is under the leadership of Shailesh Chandra. As per reports, the share entitlement ratio will be 1:1, so that Tata Motors shareholders will hold the same proportion in both companies.\n\nAs per a report of The Economic Times, Tata Motors has set October 14, 2025, as the record date for the planned demerger of its commercial vehicle division. On this day, each Tata Motors shareholder will be allotted one fully paid share of TMLCV for every share they own in Tata Motors, with each share carrying a face value of INR 2. These shares are proposed to be listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE), once all regulatory approvals are completed.

Rahul Gandhi Hails Indian Two-Wheeler Manufacturers, Says 'Proud To See Bajaj, Hero & TVS Do So Well in Colombia'.\n\nAs per reports, Tata Motors commercial vehicle business covering buses, trucks, and other heavy-duty models is overseen by Girish Wagh. The passenger vehicle arm, which includes cars, SUVs, electric models, and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is under the leadership of Shailesh Chandra. As per reports, the share entitlement ratio will be 1:1, so that Tata Motors shareholders will hold the same proportion in both companies.\n\nAs per a report of The Economic Times, Tata Motors has set October 14, 2025, as the record date for the planned demerger of its commercial vehicle division. On this day, each Tata Motors shareholder will be allotted one fully paid share of TMLCV for every share they own in Tata Motors, with each share carrying a face value of INR 2. These shares are proposed to be listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE), once all regulatory approvals are completed.

    "Title": "Best Navratri In Decade For Car Sales: Maruti, SUV Sales Fuel India's Strongest Festive Surge In 10 Years",
    "Explanation": "India's carmakers have led the charge in what turned out to be the strongest Navratri sales season in over a decade, setting the stage for a blockbuster Diwali, The Economic Times reported.\n\nMaruti Suzuki, the country's top car manufacturer, recorded its best-ever Navratri sales in at least 10 years, with sales doubling compared to last year. As of Wednesday, there were 700,530 enquiries for the cars and 150,000 bookings, with expectations to touch 200,000 bookings by Thursday evening. Last year, the company sold 85,000 vehicles during Navratri.\n\nMahindra & Mahindra also rode the festive wave, reporting a 60% jump in retails, driven by its popular SUVs XUV700 and Scorpio N. Hyundai witnessed strong demand for the Creta and Venue, with SUVs contributing more than 72% of its total sales. Hero MotoCorp, meanwhile, reported double showroom footfalls with commuter bikes seeing robust traction.\n\nTata Motors joined the festive success story by retailing over 50,000 vehicles during the period, with Altroz, Punch, Nexon, and Tiago leading the charge.\n\nBeyond automobiles, the festive cheer spread across consumer electronics and retail. LG, Haier, and Godrej Appliances posted high double-digit growth, with Haier's sales soaring 85% and premium TV models nearly sold out. \"The Navratri sales this year were driven by the direct benefit of the GST rate cut and the indirect boost it gave to customer sentiment,\" said Satish NS, president of Haier India, told the English publication.\n\nLG's Sanjay Chitkara echoed the optimism, describing the growth as \"exponential.\"\n\nRetail too saw strong gains, with Reliance Retail reporting a 20-25% jump in sales compared to last year. Footfalls at malls picked up steadily after Amazon and Flipkart's mega online sales, bringing fresh momentum to offline stores.\n\nThe Economic Times report highlights that this year's Navratri demand surged between 25% and 100% across categories, marking a sharp turnaround after five to six years of sluggish consumption. With the first half of the festive season already proving buoyant, companies are now gearing up for Diwali, Dhanteras, and the wedding season - all expected to add further sparkle to India's consumption story.",

    "Title": "September '25 Car Sales: Maruti on top, this brand climbs to 2nd spot! - The Times of India",
    "Explanation": "September 2025 saw a mixed performance in India's car market. Maruti Suzuki retained dominance despite domestic sales dips, while Tata Motors achieved record sales, driven by Nexon, EV, and CNG models. Hyundai and Mahindra also posted strong growth, though Honda Cars India experienced a significant sales decline.The introduction of GST 2.0 and the onset of the festive season made September 2025 a crucial month for India's car market. However, the results were a mixed bag. While some brands rode the tax relief and festive demand to record-breaking numbers, others faced pressure in their entry-level offerings. The overall market also saw a reshuffle in rankings. Here's how the month has been for the major mass-market OEMs.At the top, Maruti Suzuki India continued its dominance with 189,665 units sold. The company's exports were the standout, hitting an all-time high of 42,204 units, up 52% from a year ago. However, domestic passenger vehicle sales slipped 8% to 132,820 units, weighed down by slower demand for entry-level cars and utility vehicles. Despite the dip, Maruti benefited from strong festive buying, clocking 1.65 lakh deliveries during Navratri's opening week, laying the ground for a busy October.The headline-grabber of the month, though, was Tata Motors. The homegrown giant recorded its best-ever monthly performance with 60,907 cars sold, surging 47% year-on-year. Leading the charge was the Nexon, which registered more than 22,500 units: the highest-ever monthly sales for any single Tata model. EV sales nearly doubled to 9,191 units, and CNG models scaled past 17,800 units.Meanwhile, Mahindra & Mahindra reported a 16% YoY increase in overall sales to 1,00,298 units. Within this, utility vehicles accounted for 56,233 units, a 10% rise, while exports grew 43% to 4,320 units.Hyundai Motor India had a strong month as well, posting 70,347 units, up 10% from last year. Domestic sales stood at 51,547 units. SUVs contributed a record 72.4% of Hyundai's volumes, with the Creta (18,861 units) notching its highest-ever sales and the Venue (11,484 units) hitting a 20-month high. Exports rose sharply to 18,800 units, a growth of 44% year-on-year.Other players also reported growth: Toyota Kirloskar Motor delivered 31,091 units, up 16% from last year, while Kia India sold 22,700 units, reflecting nearly 16% growth over August. JSW MG Motor India posted 6,728 units, up 34% year-on-year.Honda Cars India, however, saw sales drop 26% to 8,096 units, with domestic volumes at 5,303 units and exports at 2,793 units.",

    "Title": "Tata Motors Q2 FY26 Sales Commercial Vehicles Sales Registered by Tata Motors Ltd in Q2 FY26",
    "Explanation": "Sales in the domestic & international market for Q2 FY26 stood at 94,681 units, compared to 84,281 units during Q2 FY25.\n\nDomestic sales of MH&ICV in September 2025, was 15,669 units vs 14,190 units in September 2024; In Q2 FY26 it was 41,461 units, compared to 37,372 units in Q2 FY25.\n\nDomestic & International sales for MH&ICV in September 2025, was 16,759 units vs 14,839 units in September 2024; while in Q2 FY26 it stood at 45,095 units, vs 39,433 units in Q2 FY25.\n\nMr. Girish Wagh, Executive Director of Tata Motors Ltd., said, \"Q2 FY26 was a mixed quarter for the commercial vehicles industry, start marked by subdued market conditions and ending with a promising resurgence in demand. While July faced headwinds due to monsoon and August reflected cautious sentiment ahead of the GST 2.0 rollout, the onset of the festive season and lower GST rates from late September brought a good recovery in sales, bookings and sentiment.\n\nFollowing the GST reduction announcement, we acted swiftly and decisively to capture the growth in demand -- by enhancing product availability, sharpening our pricing strategy, and intensifying market activations. These initiatives helped us unlock demand across segments, making September our best-performing sales month in FY26, driven by a strong 30% YoY growth in our SCV and PU portfolio led by the new launches, Ace Pro and Ace Gold+.\n\nOverall, in Q2 FY26, Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles delivered sales of 94,681 units, registering a growth of 12% over the same period last year. We continue to build strong differentiation for our expansive range of trucks that now offer higher power output of up to 320hp. With smart engineering and a relentless focus on operational efficiency, our trucks remain the preferred choice for fleet owners seeking better performance, higher profits and long-term value.\n\nLooking ahead, with the festive season underway, improving consumption, and the full impact of GST reforms yet to unfold, we anticipate a strong second half for FY26. Construction, infrastructure, and mining activities will gain momentum, further fueling demand for trucks and tippers. With a robust pipeline of upcoming launches, and a richer, more customer-aligned product portfolio, we are well-positioned to accelerate this momentum and drive meaningful, broad-based growth across all commercial vehicles segments.\"\n\nPassenger Vehicles Sales Registered by Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd in Q2 FY26\n\nSales in the domestic & international market for Q2 FY26 stood at 144,397 units, compared to 130,753 units during Q2 FY25.\n\nIncludes sales of Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Limited, subsidiary of Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd.\n\nMr. Shailesh Chandra, Managing Director, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd. said, \"The passenger vehicles industry marked a sharp upswing in demand during September 2025 following the rollout of GST 2.0, further buoyed by festive tailwinds. This surge in demand sets a promising tone for sustained growth in the months ahead.\n\nFor Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles, September 2025 emerged as a watershed month with sales of 60,907 units (domestic wholesales of 59,667 units), our highest ever, marking a substantial 47% year-on-year growth. This milestone was complimented by record-breaking performances across our green fuel portfolio: EV sales surged 96%+ year-on-year to 9,191 units, setting a new benchmark, while CNG sales reached an all-time high of over 17,800 units, reflecting a remarkable 105%+ growth compared to Q2FY25.\n\nAcross our portfolio, customer interest remained exceptionally strong with new bookings doubling in the latter half of September following the lowering of GST rates. Leading this surge was the Nexon, which delivered a record-breaking performance with over 22,500 units sold in a single month, marking the highest-ever sales for any Tata Motors passenger vehicle. The Harrier and Safari continued their upward momentum, fueled by the rising popularity of their newly launched Adventure X edition and the availability of multiple powertrain options, leading to their best-ever combined sales. Additionally, the Punch continued to expand its widespread appeal, further cementing its status as the popular choice among customers in the compact SUV segment.\n\nIn Q2 FY26, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles delivered sales of 144,397 units, registering a robust, double-digit year-on-year (YoY) growth of more than 10%. While the entire product portfolio saw strong traction, our electric vehicle strategy stood out prominently. Quarterly EV sales surged 59% YoY to nearly 25,000 units, recording our highest-ever EV performance and contributing a record 17% to overall sales. This milestone underscores the growing consumer confidence in sustainable, zero-emission mobility. Additionally, our strategic foray into South Africa marked a significant milestone in our global expansion journey, with 5x export volumes compared to the previous year, highlighting the strength of our brand and product appeal in international markets.\n\nGoing forward, with a strong booking pipeline, agile supply readiness, and rising demand driven by festive cheer and accessible pricing, we are well-positioned to carry this growth momentum in H2 FY26.\"\n\nImportant Note: Pursuant to the Composite Scheme of Arrangement approved by the Hon'ble National Company Law Tribunal, effective October 1, 2025, Tata Motors has demerged its Commercial Vehicles business into TML Commercial Vehicles Limited (TMLCV), and consolidated the Passenger Vehicles business within the parent entity.\n\nSales figures referenced in this release pertain to the quarter ended September 30, 2025, prior to the scheme's effective date. Following the allotment and listing of TMLCV shares (record date for which has been fixed as October 14, 2025), both listed entities will independently publish their respective press releases going forward.",

    "Title": "Tata Motors demerger: No capital gains tax on receipt but be careful when you sell",
    "Explanation": "The demerger of Tata Motors, effective October 1, will separate the automotive major's commercial vehicle (CV) and passenger vehicle (PV) businesses into two independent listed companies.\n\nThose holding shares of Tata Motors on October 14 , the record date, will get one equity share of the new CV company for every one share they hold in Tata Motors. TML Commercial Vehicles Ltd is expected to list by early November.\n\nMoneycontrol takes a look at how capital gains tax works on sale of shares after a demerger:\n\nThe cost of acquisition\n\nWhen a company demerges and you receive new shares, it's not \"free\" stock. You need to split your original cost of acquisition between the original company and the new one based on their net book values (NBV), not on the market price.\n\n\"Listed companies generally disclose the exact apportionment ratio in their corporate announcements or through exchanges. Investors should simply apply that ratio to their original purchase price,\" said Kunal Sharma, founder & managing partner, Taraksh Lawyers & Consultants.\n\n\"Most companies publish this ratio, for example 60:40, either in their scheme of arrangement or via communications from the registrar and Transfer Agent (RTA). So if you bought shares for Rs 1,000 originally, Rs 600 becomes the cost of the old company and Rs 400 becomes the cost for the new one. This is the simplest, most accurate way to do it even for small investors,\" said Shreya Jaiswal, chartered accountant and founder, Fawkes Solutions, a brand strategy firm.\n\nThe same methodology will apply when Tata Motors' percentage ratio for NBV is announced.\n\nAs of now, at the time you get these new shares on demerger, there is no tax implication. You just have a new share in your demat account and you have to disclose the purchase price.\n\nSection 47(vib)/(vid)/(vb) of the income-tax act provides a clear relief: the transfer of shares under a scheme of demerger is not treated as a taxable transfer in the hands of shareholders.\n\n\"This means that simply receiving shares of the resulting company does not trigger capital gains tax. Tax arises only when the investor actually sells the shares,\" Sharma said.\n\nFor retail investors, there is no special exemption beyond this. The cost of acquisition is apportioned under Section 49(2C)/(2D), and the holding period carries over.\n\nHolding period and capital gains\n\n\"When shares are eventually sold, capital gains are computed in the usual way, based on the split cost and carried-over holding period,\" Sharma said.\n\nIn a demerger, the law ensures continuity. Section 2(42A) of the I-T act says the holding period of the resulting company's shares is deemed to include the holding period of the parent company's shares. Simply put, the \"clock\" does not restart.\n\n\"Thus, if an investor had held the parent shares for more than 12 months before the demerger, both the parent and the resulting company's shares will qualify as long-term,\" Sharma said.\n\nEven where the parent shares were acquired in different lots, the respective acquisition dates of those lots continue for the proportionate demerged shares. For retail investors, the guiding principle is simple: the age of your shares remains the same after a demerger.\n\nThis means that your holding period doesn't reset after a demerger. If you bought shares in 2021 and the demerger happened in 2023, the holding period for both the old and new company counts from 2021. \"This matters because it often pushes your gains into the long-term capital gains (LTCG) bracket, which is taxed more favourably. Many investors don't realise this and end up misreporting or overpaying tax,\" Jaiswal said.\n\nIn case both Tata Motors and the demerged company declare dividends separately, tax will be deducted at source, and the dividend will be taxed as income from other sources. \"This is the standard taxation, separate from capital gains, so investors need to account for it while filing returns,\" said Vivek Jalan, partner, Tax Connect Advisory Services.\n\nAvoid penalties: track demerged shares right\n\nKeep the original communication from the company or RTA that shows the NBV ratio. Label your shares manually in your demat spreadsheet or in your trading account. When you sell, cross-check your cost basis with what you initially calculated not just what the platform tells you.\n\n\"If you're filing your return, report these sales properly under Schedule 112A. Many tax software platforms support this now but your numbers need to be correct,\" said Jaiswal.",

    "Explanation": "Shares of Tata Motors Ltd rose sharply, leading the gainers of Nifty 50 pack on Friday, riding investor optimism driven by the company's recent demerger, Q2FY26 sales, and favourable developments in its key subsidiaries.\n\nThe stock soared nearly 3 per cent to an intraday high of 739.70. It has zoomed nearly 13 per cent from the low of 655.30 on September 25, 2025.\n\nAt 11 am on Friday, the stock traded flat at ₹719.\n\nDemerger\n\nOn October 1, Tata Motors officially initiated its long-anticipated demerger, splitting its commercial vehicles (CV) operations and passenger vehicles / EV (including Jaguar Land Rover) operations into separately listed entities -- TML Commercial Vehicles Ltd and Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd.\n\nAs per the composite scheme of arrangement, the shareholders will receive one share of the new CV entity (TMLCV) for every existing share held -- a 1:1 entitlement ratio -- as on the record date of October 14, 2025.\n\nAuto trends and sales\n\nTata Motors recorded strong growth (of 10 per cent y-o-y) in passenger vehicle sales for the second quarter of FY26, registering 144,397 units, compared to 130,753 units in the same period last year.\n\nThe commercial vehicles sales in the domestic and international market for Q2 FY26 stood at 94,681 units, compared to 84,281 units during Q2 FY25.\n\nJLR Operations\n\nTata Motors arm Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) had been hit by a crippling cyberattack earlier in September, which forced a halt in production and supply chain disruptions.\n\nOn Monday, the automaker said it will partially restart production in the coming days. According to a Bloomberg report, JLR is securing £3.5 billion ($4.7 billion) in loan commitments as it continues to grapple with the fallout. This follows the £1.5 billion loan guarantee from the UK government and sought to raise a further £2 billion from banks to shore up its finances during the shutdown, the report read.\n\nComments\n\nPublished on October 3, 2025\n\nCompanies to followTata Motors LtdREAD MORE",
